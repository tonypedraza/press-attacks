Two visitors to Syafruddin's house beat him with a metal rod on August 13, inflicting serious injuries to his head and stomach. The assailants fled on a motorcycle immediately after the attack. Syafruddin, also known as Udin, was admitted to the intensive care unit of a Catholic hospital in Yogyakarta but never regained consciousness. He died in the hospital three days after the attack. Local sources speculated that Syafruddin's death may have been related to his articles on land disputes and government corruption in Bantul, the Yogyakarta suburb that he covered for Bernas.  CPJ sent a letter to President Suharto on August 20 expressing alarm about the murder. The committee called on the Indonesian leader to order a complete investigation into Syafruddin's death, as well as public disclosure of the investigation's findings.  In October, Indonesia's National Committee on Human Rights began an inquiry into Syafruddin's death, and police in Jogyakarta arrested a suspect. However, according to press reports, Syafruddin's widow claimed that the suspect, Dwi Sumadji, was not one of the men she saw kill her husband. She says he is a foil to deflect blame from the guilty parties.  In December, the Indonesian Journalist Association (PWI) told reporters that Syafruddin was beaten to death because of his stories about corruption, and not by a jealous husband as policed alleged shortly after the attack. PWI chairman Sofyan Lubis said that evidence and testimony at the trial of the alleged killer confirmed the association's findings. The court concluded that there was insufficient evidence against Sumadji, and prosecutors dropped the charges against him. The ruling led to an investigation into the conduct of two police officers accused of forcing Sumadji to admit he killed Syafruddin because the reporter was having an affair with his wife."},{"id":1800,"location":"Ireland","year":"1996","name":"Veronica Guerin","organization":"Sunday independent","date":"June 26, 1996","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Dublin","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Crime","gender":"Female","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group","impunity":"Partial Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Guerin, a crime reporter for the Sunday Independent, was shot dead by assailants on a motorcycle as she was stopped in her car at a traffic light in Dublin.

On November 28, 1998, he embarked on a 10-day trip to report on the Huichol Indians, an indigenous population that lives in a mountainous area stretching across Nayarit, Jalisco, and Durango states.  The journalist was last seen alive on December 4 in the village of Salmotita. On December 16, after an intensive search by the Mexican military, True's body was found in a shallow grave partially covered with rocks at the bottom of a ravine. Neither his wedding ring nor his watch had been taken, suggesting that robbery was not a motive.  On December 26, 1998, authorities arrested Juan Chivarra de la Cruz and his brother-in-law Miguel Hern·ndez de la Cruz, both Huichol Indians, and charged them with True's murder. Under questioning, Chivarra and Hernández confessed to murdering True because he had taken photographs without their permission. The journalist's belongings, including his camera, binoculars, and backpack, were found at the suspects' homes.  When the two men were brought into court, however, they acknowledged killing True but claimed they had acted in self-defense. They also claimed that their confession had been extracted under torture. Jalisco State Attorney General Gerardo Octavio Solís Gómez has repeatedly denied these claims.  Additional evidence points to the suspects' culpability. In 1999, a Newsweek reporter found a notebook belonging to True in a warehouse where case evidence was stored. In one entry, True described an encounter with a Huichol man named Juan, possibly a reference to Chivarra.  Both suspects have repeatedly given contradictory statements in interviews with the San Antonio Express-News. While they initially contended that they had never seen True, they later admitted to meeting him. Then in an interview published on August 8, 2001, both men claimed they had seen the journalist but never talked to him.  Mexican authorities have issued three separate forensic reports since True's body was found. The first, based on an autopsy by Jalisco State medical examiners, found that True had been strangled with his own bandana and sustained a head injury that was not attributable to a fall.  The second report, based on an autopsy by the Federal Attorney General's Office, concluded that True died from blows to his head and body and from edema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs), most likely after suffering an accidental fall caused by heavy drinking. Both autopsies found a high concentration of alcohol in True's blood, a finding consistent with advanced decomposition, according to forensic experts consulted by the Express-News.  It remains unclear why federal authorities ordered a second autopsy. True's already decomposed body was essentially dismembered during the first autopsy, making the possibility of drawing accurate conclusions from a second autopsy difficult at best.  In March 2000, the third forensic report, which is required under Mexican law when two autopsies yield different results, found that True's death was caused by a pulmonary edema resulting from a head injury. This conclusion was based solely on the examiner's analysis of the first two autopsy reports.  On August 3, 2001, Mexican Judge José Luis Reyes Contreras acquitted Chivarra and Hernández and ordered their release. On August 7, Jalisco Attorney General Solís Gómez said there was enough evidence to convict the two men and added that he would appeal the verdict.  Judge Reyes Contreras has been quoted as saying that his decision to release the men was based on the second autopsy report, which concluded that True's death was accidental. The judge's ruling did not account for the fact that True's belongings were found in the two suspects' homes or that his body was hidden in a grave near the death site.  The Jalisco State Attorney General's Office appealed the acquittals in a September 25, 2001, hearing before a panel of three magistrates from the State Supreme Court of Justice. On May 30, 2002, a three-judge appeals panel sentenced Chivarra and Hernández to 13-year prison terms for True's murder. The unanimous ruling overturned an August 2001 verdict that had acquitted the two men.  In February 2003, a federal court overturned the 13-year sentences on procedural grounds. In November 2003, both the private investigator who worked to win the release of the men and the U.S. citizen who funded portions of their defense said Chivarra and Hernández had privately confessed to killing True and should be brought to justice.  On April 27, 2004, a three-judge panel of the Jalisco State Supreme Court convicted the men, sentenced them to 20 years in prison each, and ordered each to pay 117,315 Mexican pesos (U$10,000) in damages, Jorge Ochoa, the lawyer of True's widow, Martha True, told CPJ.  The ruling, issued by judges Celso Rodríguez González, Gustavo Flores Martínez, and Guillermo Valdez Angulo, also ordered the capture of the two men, who are now free on bond and are believed to be living in the area of Sierra Madre.  Chivarra and Herná ndez can file an appeal (recurso de amparo), but Ochoa told CPJ he doubts they will."},{"id":1384,"location":"Nigeria","year":"1998","name":"Okezie Amaruben","organization":"Newsservice","date":"September 2, 1998","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Enugu","job":"Publisher / Owner","medium":"Print","coverage":"Business, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","impunity":"Partial Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Amaruben, publisher of Newsservice magazine, was shot and killed by an Enugu State police officer.

According to the attorney general's office, Jiménez was killed in retaliation for a story she broadcast in 1996 about the murder of peasants by a right-wing paramilitary death squad. Quintero's assassination may also have been prompted by his public denunciation, in July, of an attack on the home of Saída Maestre, a presumed guerrilla sympathizer, in the town of Patillal. Quintero published the article after speaking with Maestre, who was then kidnapped on July 5. Her horribly mutilated body was found sometime later.

The AUC denied responsibility for Garzón's death, and it remains unclear who ordered the murder. While some local journalists blame the AUC, others blame drug traffickers or the military.

He was internationally acclaimed for his groundbreaking reporting on political corruption and organized crime in Mozambique, a country that is still recovering from a brutal, 17-year civil war.\n\n Earlier in his career, Cardoso served as editor and later director of the Mozambique state news agency AIM, from which he resigned in 1989. Before founding Metical in 1998, Cardoso ran another independent fax newsletter, Mediafax, which he launched in 1992. He sympathized politically with the ruling FRELIMO party but often lambasted the government in his editorials.\n\n One week before his death, Cardoso started a campaign against what he called the \"gangster faction\" in FRELIMO, which he accused of provoking recent political violence in the country. Metical had also been reporting aggressively on alleged wrongdoing at the Mozambique Commercial Bank (BCM), according to the London-based anti-censorship organization ARTICLE 19.\n\n On the day of Cardoso's assassination, unknown attackers slashed the tongue of Radio Mozambique journalist Custadio Rafael for \"speaking too much,\" according to news reports.

Outside Mozambique, the U.S. State Department, the European Union, and several African nations denounced Cardoso's murder as a serious setback to press freedom in Mozambique.\n\n On November 24, a group of 500 outraged local journalists and citizens marched from the headquarters of the Mozambican Journalists Union in downtown Maputo to the site of Cardoso's assassination in the suburb of Polana.\nIn March 2001, Mozambican authroities arrested Momade Abdul Satar, his brother Ayob Abdul Satar, and Vincente Ramaya, a local bank official, and charged them with ordering Cardoso's murder. Police also arrested three young men from the Maputo underworld alleged to have carried out the assassination. Both the Satars and Ramaya were involved in a money laundering scandal at BCM dating back to 1996, which Metical covered aggressively.

But when the\njournalists returned to the morgue with a car and a coffin, they found\nthat the state prosecutor had already removed the corpse and\ntransported it to Kyiv for DNA testing. In late November, the\nprosecutor's office launched a half-hearted effort to secure blood\nsamples from Gongadze's family, only obtaining the samples in\nmid-December.\n\nOn November 28, Oleksandr Moroz, the leader of the Socialist Party and\na longtime rival of President Kuchma, released tape recordings of what\nhe claimed were conversations between Kuchma, Presidential Chief of\nStaff Vladimir Litvin, and Interior Minister Yury Kravchenko. On the\ntape, three male voices discuss various ways of \"dealing\" with\nGongadze. In casual, profanity-laced tones, they discuss undercover\nsurveillance, deporting him back to his native Georgia, prosecuting him\nin Ukraine, or having a group of Chechens kidnap him. The speakers are\nclearly concerned about Gongadze's journalism. \"You give me this same\none at Ukrainska Pravda and we will start to decide what to do with him,\" one says. \"He's simply gone too far.\"\n\nMoroz claimed he had received the tapes in mid-October from an unnamed\nformer officer of the Special Communication Detachment of Ukraine's\nState Security Service (SBU) who was responsible for communications\nsecurity within President Kuchma's office, the Kyiv Post\nreported. Moroz said he had delayed releasing the tapes until late\nNovember in order to have them authenticated by foreign experts, and to\ngive the source's family time to leave the country.\n\nIn early December, three Ukrainian Parliament deputies traveled to an\nundisclosed European Union country and videotaped their meeting with\nthe officer, who was identified as Mykola Melnychenko, a 34-year-old\nmajor. On the video, Major Melnychenko claims that he secretly recorded\nKuchma's conversations by placing a digital audio recorder under a sofa\nin the president's office. Melnychenko justifies his actions by saying,\n\"I gave my oath of allegiance to Ukraine, to the people of Ukraine. I\ndid not break my oath. I did not swear allegiance to Kuchma to perform\nhis criminal orders.\"\n\nAt year's end, the tapes had not yet been authenticated by a neutral\nthird party. But it seemed credible for several reasons, according to a\nCPJ source close to the investigation who did not wish to be\nidentified. The informal manner of speaking and frequent use of\nexpletives match Kuchma's conversational style. Also, researchers from\nthe Dutch Institute of Applied Scientific Research, hired by a Dutch\ntabloid to evaluate the tapes, concluded that the recordings had not\nbeen doctored, although they were unable to identify the voices\nconclusively, the Kyiv Post\nreported. And while Moroz was a bitter rival of Kuchma, he was known to\nbe relatively cautious in making accusations against other politicians,\nparticularly the president.\n Kuchma flatly denied\nthat he had anything to do with Gongadze's disappearance and described\nthe Moroz tape as a \"provocation,\" according to the ITAR-TASS news\nagency.\n\nThe government's agitated response to the scandal only fueled public\nsuspicion. A presidential spokesman denied Moroz's allegations on the\nsame day that he made them. Meanwhile, a local prosecutor announced he\nwas launching a criminal investigation into Moroz's alleged \"insults\nand slander\" against President Kuchma.\n\nOn December 4, just as the allegations against Kuchma were gaining\nmomentum, Kyiv police announced that Gongadze had died in an attempted\nrobbery. But by then, public confidence in the investigation had\ndwindled to a point where some opposition politicians were even\nquestioning whether the body being examined in Kyiv was the same corpse\nthat was found in Tarashcha.\n\nOn December 18, Gongadze's wife, Myroslava, identified the jewelry\nfound by the body in Tarashcha as belonging to her husband. And\nalthough the corpse was badly decomposed, she claimed to recognize her\nhusband's foot.\n\nIn late December, German forensic experts determined that the corpse\nfound in Tarashcha was indeed Gongadze's, according to the German news\nagency Deutsche Presse-Agentur. The Ukrainian government promised to\nconduct DNA tests but had not yet done so by early January."},{"id":1883,"location":"Ukraine","year":"2000","name":"Yuliy Mazur","organization":"Yug","date":"November 30, 2000","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Odessa","freelance":"No","description":"Mazur, the 63-year-old editor of the independent Russian-Ukrainian daily Yug, was found late at night near his house in Odessa.

As Brandão was surveying the exterior of the building with an engineer from the construction company, the gunmen approached him, shot him in the chest and head, and fled on the motorcycle. Several people witnessed the murder.\n\n In an October 1, 2002, editorial, Folha do Estado blamed the murder on a \"parallel power,\" a reference to organized crime groups that it said had taken over Mato Grosso. The paper attributed Brandão's death to its extensive coverage of drug trafficking, illegal gambling, and government corruption. Brandão had not received any threats, the newspaper said.\n\n On October 2, 2002, police arrested former police officers Hércules de Araújo Agostinho and Célio Alves de Souza in connection with the murder of Brandão.

Two days later, police announced that ballistic tests confirmed one of the weapons found was used in Brandão's murder.\n\n In early December 2002, a federal judge ordered that former police officer-turned-businessman João Arcanjo Ribeiro be held in temporary detention after federal and state prosecutors identified him as the head of a major organized crime group and linked him to several homicides, including the murder of Brandão. Ribeiro fled, and was arrested in Uruguay in 2003 and held in detention there while awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\n Later that month, Ribeiro was formally charged with masterminding Brandão's murder in retaliation for his newspaper's criticism of organized crime and illegal gambling.

His driver met him there at around 8 p.m., but the journalist said he needed more time to finish his work. They agreed to meet again at 10 p.m., but Lopes never arrived. This was Lopes' fourth visit to Vila Cruzeiro, and he was carrying a hidden camera.\n\n According to TV Globo, Lopes was working on a report about parties hosted by drug traffickers in Vila Cruzeiro that allegedly involved drugs and the sexual exploitation of minors. Favela residents had told Lopes that they were powerless against drug traffickers and had complained about the lack of police action.\n\n On June 3, TV Globo reported Lopes' disappearance to the police.\n\n According to the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police, two suspects, both members of a gang headed by local drug trafficker Elias Pereira da Silva, also known as \"Crazy Elias,\" were arrested on the morning of June 9. Both men claimed that they heard how Lopes was murdered but denied any involvement in his killing.\n\n According to the suspects' depositions, details of which the police released and the Brazilian press published, drug traffickers close to Pereira da Silva kidnapped Lopes in Vila Cruzeiro at around midnight on June 2. After Lopes told them he was a TV Globo reporter, the traffickers called Pereira da Silva, who was in a nearby favela.\n\n They tied Lopes' hands, forced him into a car, and took him to the favela where Pereira da Silva was staying. There, they beat the reporter and shot him in the feet to keep him from escaping. They then held a mock trial and sentenced Lopes to death.\n\n Pereira da Silva killed Lopes with a sword, and his body was burned and put in a hidden burial ground, said the suspects.\n\n On June 12, police found badly decomposed human remains, along with Lopes' camera and watch in Favela da Grota. After DNA tests, police confirmed on July 5 that the remains belonged to Lopes. Two days later, they were officially buried.\n\n Lopes had received Brazil's most important journalism award in December 2001 for a TV Globo report on drug trafficking. The report, titled \"Drug Fair,\" and broadcast in August 2001, was filmed with a hidden camera and showed how traffickers sold drugs in a makeshift open drug market in a favela outside Rio de Janeiro. Reporter Cristina Guimarães, who co-produced the piece with Lopes and two other colleagues, received death threats in September 2001 and had to leave Rio de Janeiro State, according to the daily O Estado de S. Paulo. The daily Jornal do Brasil reported that Lopes had also received threats for the report.\n\n On September 19, after a two-day search, police apprehended drug lord Pereira da Silva. In early August, several members of his gang who had also been charged with murdering the journalist were either arrested or killed in a shoot-out with the police. \n At year's end, Pereira da Silva and his accomplices remained in jail.

Shortly before his death he had told colleagues that if anything happened to him Tapasco would be to blame. The former politician denied involvement in the killing.\nOn the same day Sierra was shot, police arrested 21-year-old Luis Fernando Soto Zapata, who later confessed to having shot Sierra and was sentenced on May 8, 2002, to 19 and a half years in prison.\nSoto told the court that he shot Sierra on a whim after mistaking him for a man who allegedly killed a relative several years ago. However, a public prosecutor told CPJ that he doubted the claim, pointing out that footage from a hidden police camera showed Soto lingering for more than two hours before the shooting at the spot where Sierra was killed.\nPolice also arrested Luis Arley Ortiz on the day Sierra was shot. Authorities released Ortiz soon after, but issued a warrant for his arrest again in May 2, alleging that he acted as a middleman between a gang of assassins and the person or people who allegedly ordered Sierra's death. He was convicted, along with Luis Tabares Hernández, also known as Tilín, to 28 years in prison.\nOn July 17, authorities charged Francisco Antonio Quintero Tabares with homicide for Sierra's killing. Quintero is believed to be the boss of the gang of hit men that allegedly included Soto.\nFearing the Sierra murder would remain unsolved, seven Colombian newspapers and magazines formed Project Manizales to try to investigate the case. The Sierra killing was also the subject of a documentary, \"The Battle of Silence.\" In the ensuing years, at least nine witnesses were murdered, the Bogotá-based Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP) said in a statement.\nIn 2011, nine years after Sierra was killed, authorities charged Tapasco with being one of the suspected masterminds of the crime. Tapasco was also convicted in 2010 for working with paramilitary death squads, according to news reports. In late 2013, Tapasco was acquitted but prosecutors said they would appeal. In June 2015, he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to 36 years in prison. In November 2015, he was captured by authorities in Manizales, according to news reports.\nThe court also convicted Fabio López Escobar and Jorge Hernando López Escobar of murder in the Sierra case and sentenced them in absentia to nearly 29 years in prison.

However, colleagues at the Manipur Electronic Media Journalists Union, of which Meghajit was vice president, said his work had not been particularly controversial.Meghajit was also a dealer in semiprecious stones, and some journalists speculate that he was killed in connection with this business."},{"id":761,"location":"Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory","year":"2002","name":"Imad Abu Zahra","organization":"Freelance","date":"July 12, 2002","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Jenin","job":"Photographer","medium":"Print","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Abu Zahra, a Palestinian freelance photographer who also worked as a fixer and interpreter for foreign journalists, died after being hit by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) gunfire in the West Bank town of Jenin.\n\n According to sources in Jenin, residents had gone into the city center on July 11 after Israeli forces lifted a curfew that had been in effect since June 21. Abu Zahra's colleague Said Dahla, a photographer for the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, told CPJ that at around 2 p.m., the sound of tanks coming toward the area led residents to flee or take cover inside nearby businesses or residences.\n\n Together, Dahla and Abu Zahra went into the middle of Faisal Street to photograph an Israeli armored personnel carrier (APC) that had slammed into an electricity pole there. Dahla said that he and Abu Zahra were alone in the street at this point facing two Israeli tanks (near the APC), which he estimated to be about 40 meters (45 yards) in front of them.\n\n Both men were holding cameras, according to Dahla, and Dahla wore a flak jacket clearly marked \"Press.\" Dahla said that Abu Zahra also wore a cloth vest that identified him as a member of the press.\n\n According to Dahla, moments after the two began taking photographs, gunfire erupted from the tanks. Dahla, who was hit in the leg with bullet shrapnel, said that he looked over and saw that Abu Zahra had been injured in his thigh and was bleeding profusely.\n\n Dahla said that as they tried to take shelter in a nearby building, the tanks continued to fire on them. Dahla told CPJ that the two journalists remained in the building entrance, unable to get to a hospital. He estimates that more than 25 minutes passed before Abu Zahra was helped into a taxi and taken to Jenin Hospital, where he died on July 12.\n\n According to an Israeli army spokesperson, after the APC hit the electricity pole on the afternoon of July 11, a mob attacked the personnel carrier with Molotov cocktails and rocks, and people in the crowd fired on the tanks. The spokesperson said the soldiers in the tanks responded by firing back at the source of the gunfire.\n\n However, witnesses who were at the city center at the time told CPJ that residents did not attack the tanks until after the two journalists had been shot. Photos of the stranded APC taken by Dahla before the shooting show no signs of clashes or hostile action near the carrier.

The faces of the assailants are not visible on the video, according to news reports.\n\n Pearl, 38, went missing on January 23 in the port city of Karachi, Pakistan, and was last seen on his way to an interview at the Village Restaurant, downtown near the Metropole Hotel. According to The Wall Street Journal, Pearl had been reporting on Richard Reid, a suspected terrorist who allegedly tried to blow up an airplane during a transatlantic flight with a bomb in his shoe.\n\n Four days after his disappearance, a group calling itself \"The National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty\" sent an e-mail to several U.S.- and Pakistan-based news organizations claiming responsibility for kidnapping Pearl and accusing him of being an American spy. The e-mail also contained four photographs of the journalist, including one in which he is held at gunpoint and another in which he is holding a copy of the January 24 issue of Pakistan's Dawn newspaper.\n\n The e-mail contained a series of demands, including the repatriation of Pakistani detainees held by the U.S. Army in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The sender or senders, who used a Hotmail e-mail account under the name \"Kidnapperguy,\" said Pearl was \"at present being kept in very inhuman circumstances quite similar infact [sic] to the way that Pakistanis and nationals of other sovereign countries are being kept in Cuba by the American Army.\"\n\n Another e-mail was sent on January 30, also including photographs of Pearl held captive. This e-mail accused him of being an agent of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and said he would be killed within 24 hours unless the group's demands were met.\n\n After scrutinizing the videotape that officials received weeks later, authorities believe that Pearl may have been murdered before the second e-mail was sent. During that footage, Pearl is forced to identify himself as Jewish and to deliver scripted lines reiterating some of the demands made in the e-mails, according to an FBI analysis of the tape that was provided to the Journal.\n\n On February 12, before Pearl's murder was discovered, Pakistani police announced the arrest of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, whom they identified as the prime suspect behind the journalist's kidnapping.\n\n On March 14, a U.S. grand jury indicted Saeed, charging him with hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking resulting in Pearl's murder. U.S. prosecutors also unsealed a secret indictment filed against Saeed in November 2001 accusing him of participating in the 1994 kidnapping of U.S. tourist Bela Nuss in India. Pakistan refused to extradite Saeed, possibly to avoid damaging disclosures of links between the country's intelligence agencies and militant Islamist groups that the United States wants to see eliminated.\n\n In April, Saeed and three accomplices--Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem, and Shaikh Adil--were charged with Pearl's kidnapping and murder before Pakistan's special anti-terrorism court. The trial, initially convened at Karachi's Central Jail and later moved to a heavily guarded prison in Hyderabad due to security concerns, was closed to journalists and the public.\n\n In mid-May, as the trial was under way, police found a dismembered body believed to be Pearl's buried in the outskirts of Karachi on property owned by the Al-Rashid Trust, an Islamic charity that the United States has accused of funneling money to al-Qaeda. Police were reportedly led to the shallow grave by Fazal Karim, a member of the banned militant Sunni Muslim group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. At year's end, Karim had not been charged, and though it has been widely reported that he was detained, authorities have never officially acknowledged his arrest.\n\n On July 15, the anti-terrorism court announced that Saeed and his accomplices were guilty of Pearl's kidnapping and murder. Saeed, who was accused of masterminding the crime, was sentenced to death by hanging; Saqib, Naseem, and Adil each received 25-year prison sentences. They have appealed the ruling, and the case was still pending at year's end.\n\n Shortly after the ruling, U.S. officials announced DNA test results confirming that the body found in May was indeed Pearl's.\n\n In mid-August, The Associated Press (AP) published a detailed account of Pearl's kidnapping, citing two investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity. The officials said that, according to Karim (who had led police to the journalist's body in May) and two others held in unofficial custody, Pearl was shot and wounded on the sixth day of his capture when he tried to escape and was murdered on the ninth day. The AP identified the two other detainees as Zubair Chishti and Naeem Bukhari, who is also known as Attaur Rehman and is a leader of the sectarian group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. The men also said that three Arabs, possibly from Yemen, were brought to the hideout on the ninth day, and that they were involved in filming and carrying out the execution.\n\n Karim later identified one of the Yemenis among those arrested in a September 11, 2002, raid in Karachi, during which U.S. and Pakistani authorities detained several suspected al-Qaeda members, including Ramzi Binalshibh, allegedly a senior al-Qaeda leader who has claimed a central role in coordinating the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Karim and Bukhari \"have told police that the man who slit Pearl's throat was Khalid Sheik Mohammed,\" whom U.S. intelligence officials have identified as the current head of al-Qaeda's military operations. U.S. officials have told journalists that Mohammed was not among those captured in the Karachi raids, and that his current status is unclear. He had appeared with Binalshibh in a pre-recorded interview broadcast by the Qatar-based Arabic-language satellite channel Al-Jazeera to coincide with the anniversary of the September 11 attacks.\n\n A former U.S. intelligence officer, Robert Baer, told the United Press International (UPI) news agency that he had given Pearl information about Mohammed, and that he believes it was the journalist's investigations of Mohammed that may have cost him his life. Baer, who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 20 years in Asia and the Middle East and wrote the book See No Evil, which criticizes the CIA, told UPI, \"I have heard from [intelligence] people who follow this closely that it was people close to Mohammed that killed him, if it wasn't Mohammed himself.\"\n\n UPI quoted a Wall Street Journal spokesperson as saying that, \"Everything we know from before and after Danny's murder indicates his reporting effort focused on [alleged shoe bomber] Richard Reid.\""},{"id":1658,"location":"Pakistan","year":"2002","name":"Shahid Soomro","organization":"Kawish","date":"October 20, 2002","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Kandhkot","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Human Rights","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Soomro, a correspondent for the Sindhi-language newspaper Kawish, was assassinated in the town of Kandhkot, Sindh Province, apparently in reprisal for his reporting on abuses committed during general elections held on October 10.\n\n At around midnight on October 20, three men went to Soomro's home and tried to abduct him, according to his younger brother Aziz, who witnessed the crime. When Soomro resisted, the men shot him dead. Kawish editor Ali Kazi said that Soomro had at least nine bullet wounds and died almost instantly.\n\n The gunmen escaped with two accomplices in a white car waiting outside Soomro's house, said local news reports.\n\n Aziz filed a case with police identifying three of the assailants by name, Wahid Ali Bijarani, Mohammad Ali Bijarani, and Mohammad Siddiq.\n\n Wahid Ali and Mohammad Ali, who are brothers, are members of the powerful Bijarani family, which owns much land in the area around Kandhkot and exercises considerable influence through the feudal system still prevalent in much of Pakistan.

He was killed by a single bullet wound to his left torso.\n\n On May 16, local police superintendent Asuri Hawani announced that police had identified and filed charges against an alleged hit man named Ronie Quilme based on an eyewitness' account. But the two witnesses riding in Damalerio's jeep, Edgar Amoro and Edgar Ongue, identified the gunman as local police officer Guillermo Wapile. Although an investigator from the National Bureau of Investigation said his office had recommended as early as May 17 that local prosecutors arrest Wapile, the suspect was not formally arrested. Instead, he was placed in the custody of his boss, Hawani, under \"restricted supervision\" with his fellow police officers. He was not formally charged, and could move freely in Pagadian City. According to news reports, he was seen in town stalking the witnesses and their family members during 2002.\n\n CPJ believes that Damalerio, known for his critiques of corruption among local politicians and the police, was killed for his journalistic work. According to local news reports, the journalist had criticized Hawani on his radio show for his alleged involvement with drug traffickers and crime syndicates.\n\n The day of Damalerio's murder, his wife alerted him that she had noticed two men \"casing the house,\" according to a report in the Philippine Daily Inquirer by Hernan de la Cruz, publisher of the Zamboanga Scribe. Damalerio called his wife 30 minutes before he was killed to let her know that he was on his way home. The journalist advised her to \"just close the door and lock the gate. Be careful.\"\n\n A few hours before Damalerio was shot, an employee of the Zamboanga Scribe reported receiving a number of mysterious anonymous telephone calls. On May 14, the day after the journalist's death, an unidentified male made threatening phone calls to the newspaper warning that publisher de la Cruz may be next. (De la Cruz now has a uniformed army soldier as his bodyguard.)\n\n On August 10, a possible third witness in the case, a member of a local civilian militia named Juvy Lovitaño, was murdered. He had recently contacted the National Bureau of Investigation to report that a local police officer had approached him to take out a contract on Damalerio's life.\n\n In August 2002, CPJ conducted an in-depth investigation into Damalerio's murder and met with government officials, including Interior Secretary Joey Lina, to try to move prosecution efforts forward. Lina, who dismissed Pagadian police chief Asuri Hawani after Damalerio's assassination for \"covering up the crimes of his men,\" has ordered a special investigation into the murder.\n\n Amoro and Ongue, the two witnesses riding in the car with Damalerio when he was shot, were under threat and went into the witness protection program. Fearing death threats against her and her baby boy, Damalerio's widow, Gemma, went into hiding in another province under the protection program. Despite the risks for their own safety, Damalerio's family and colleagues continued to pressure regional authorities for justice.\n\n On January 30, 2003, the Pagadian City regional trial court ordered Wapile's arrest. Wapile had been temporarily reassigned at the time to Camp Abelon in Pagadian City, where he was supposed to be restricted to the premises under the supervision of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Provincial Director Pedrito Reye.\n\n Apparently tipped off, Wapile managed to escape and evaded arrest for more than a year. In mid-2004, with a missing suspect and no leads, the case became \"dormant\" and Damlerio's widow, Amoro and Ongue lost their protection despite ongoing threats.\n\n International and domestic pressure to solve the Damalerio murder case increased until Wapile surrendered to authorities on murder charges on September 13, 2004. He pleaded not guilty to the murder charges on September 24, 2004.\n\n But Wapile's arrest did not end the reign of terror for the eyewitnesses and family members. On February 5, 2005, gunmen shot and killed Amoro while he was leaving Zamboanga del Sur National High School where he worked as a teacher. Two of the three eyewitnesses to Damalierio's murder have been murdered to keep them from testifying in court.\n\n In a February 14 ruling, the Supreme Court granted the request of Damalerio's widow to transfer the trial from Pagadian City to the more neutral Cebu City, 350 miles south of Manila. The Supreme Court also ordered the Cebu City court to ensure a speedy trial.\n\n Prison authorities were ordered to transfer Wapile from Pagadian City to Cebu City and ensure security to prevent another escape. There is still no official start date for the trial. According to local journalists, the prosecution is modifying its case, possibly to include charges against former Pagadian City Police Chief Azuri Hawani.\n\n Gemma Damalerio, Amoro's widow, and Edgar Ongue are back in the witness protection program."},{"id":1698,"location":"Philippines","year":"2002","name":"Sonny Alcantara","organization":"\"quo vadis san pablo\" and kokus","date":"August 22, 2002","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"San Pablo","job":"Broadcast Reporter, Editor","medium":"Print, Television","coverage":"Corruption","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Alcantara, a newspaper publisher and cable TV commentator, was shot dead in the city of San Pablo, south of the capital, Manila.\n\n A lone gunman shot the journalist in the forehead while he was riding a motorcycle near his home, police investigators told CPJ.

According to local press reports, the cameraman's widow, Svetlana Zavadskaya, initiated the judicial process in October 2003. Zavadsky's body was never recovered following his abduction.\n\nThe journalist was reported missing after he failed to keep a scheduled late-morning rendezvous on July 7, 2000, with his longtime colleague and friend Pavel Sheremet at the airport in Minsk.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal media reported that Zavadsky had been seen inside the airport not long before Sheremet's flight arrived from Moscow. Zavadsky's car was later found locked and parked outside the airport building. A search for the journalist by local police and officials from the local prosecutor's office turned up no clues.\n\nSheremet, a former ORT bureau chief in Minsk who now heads the station's special projects department in Moscow, had recently traveled to Chechnya with Zavadsky to shoot \"The Chechen Diary,\" a four-part documentary about the war there. CPJ sources in Belarus suspect that Zavadsky was abducted because he had footage that showed Belarusian security agents fighting alongside Chechen rebel forces.\n\nSheremet and Zavadsky's wife told reporters that shortly after Zavadsky returned from Chechnya, he began receiving phone calls from an unknown man who insisted on a meeting.\n\nZavadsky was President Aleksandr Lukashenko's personal cameraman until 1996. During the summer of 1997, local police detained Sheremet and Zavadsky while they were filming a documentary about smuggling between Belarus and Lithuania. They later received a suspended sentence for alleged illegal border crossing.\n\nSheremet has repeatedly accused Belarusian intelligence agents of being involved in Zavadsky's disappearance. Although investigators have publicly rejected this theory, Sheremet claims they do not rule it out in private. The Belarusian prosecutor's office has \"cautiously hinted that former agents of the Belarus secret services, along with some of their Russian counterparts, might have been involved,\" Sheremet told the local news agency BelaPAN.\n\nSenior Belarus officials, including Acting Interior Minister Mikhail Udovikov, have hinted that Zavadsky's disappearance may have resulted from his pro-Russian coverage of the war in Chechnya. They have also suggested that the journalist was kidnapped, either by his ORT colleagues, including Sheremet, or by members of the local opposition.\n\nIn addition to the threatening phone calls Zavadsky had received before his disappearance, two men were spotted trailing the journalist near his apartment building on the day he disappeared, Zavadsky's neighbors told police. The police commissioned artist sketches of the alleged stalkers but refused to release them. In early August 2000, police also collected samples of Zavadsky's hair from his family for testing without explaining the purpose of the tests.\n\nLater that month, police classified Zavadsky's disappearance as a premeditated crime and announced they had identified five suspects. The primary suspect, a leader of the Belarusian branch of the ultraright Russian National Unity movement named Valery Ignatovich, was in prison by the end of 2000. Police ruled out the theory that Belarusian security agents had been involved in the crime.\n\nOn November 20, 2000, local independent media had received an unsigned e-mail from a person who identified himself as an officer of the Belarus State Security Committee involved in the Zavadsky investigation. The writer claimed that nine suspects had been arrested, seven of whom were either current or former officers of the Presidential Security Service, and that the suspects had confessed to killing Zavadsky and had named the place where his body was buried. According to the e-mail, the investigators had also found a shovel stained with Zavadsky's blood.\n\nAdditionally, the e-mail claimed that President Lukashenko refused to allow investigators to exhume the body, and that the case was later transferred from the Prosecutor's Office to the Interior Ministry to sabotage the investigation.\n\nThe next day, the Belarusian State Security Council denounced the allegations, while Lukashenko blamed Zavadsky's disappearance on Chechen kidnappers. At the same time, Sheremet told BelaPAN he believed that the information from the anonymous e-mailer might be trustworthy, while local sources told CPJ that they had received similar information from other anonymous sources close to the investigation.\n\nA week after the e-mail was made public, Lukashenko fired four senior aides: his adviser on security issues, the chairman of the Security Council, the prosecutor general, and the head of the State Security Committee. Lukashenko claimed that the four men had been plotting a coup and had abducted Zavadsky in an effort to compromise the president.\n\nInterior Minister Vladimir Naumov promised to resolve the case no later than January 2001. Local observers questioned the integrity of the investigation, however, given that Naumov once headed the special police unit, Almaz, some of whose members were suspected of being involved in the crime.\n\nOn March 14, 2002, two former Almaz members, Valery Ignatovich and Maxim Malik, were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for abducting Zavadsky. Prosecutors argued that Ignatovich and Malik kidnapped the journalist in reprisal for an interview he had given to the Minsk-based Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta during which he alleged that certain unnamed Belarusians had fought with Chechen rebels against Russian forces.\n\nThe trial was held behind closed doors in the Belarusian capital, Minsk. Journalists were only allowed into the courtroom for the reading of the sentence.\n\nZavadsky's lawyer and family said the trial failed to examine credible allegations that Belarusian authorities were also involved in the abduction. Sergei Tsurko, a lawyer for Zavadsky's family, claims that Ignatovich and Malik are scapegoats and that real responsibility lies with the Belarusian government.\n\nOn March 25, 2002, the missing cameraman's relatives filed a petition with the Belarusian Supreme Court, claiming that prosecutors had not sufficiently proven that Ignatovich and Malik were responsible for kidnapping Zavadsky. The petition urged further investigation into Zavadsky's abduction and his subsequent fate.\n\nIn June 2002, two former employees of the Prosecutor General's Office, Dmitry Petrushkevich and Oleg Sluchek, who had alleged that President Lukashenko had derailed the investigation because of evidence linking a government-led death squad to Zavadsky's murder, were granted asylum in the United States.\n\nZavadsky's colleague Pavel Sheremet and local opposition groups have supported these claims.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has also publicly validated Petrushkevich and Sluchek's claims. \"We think these revelations are important,\" State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a June 19, 2002, press briefing.\n\nTwo weeks later, on July 3, 2002, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky and other U.S. officials met with Petrushkevich and Sluchek to discuss Zavadsky's disappearance and several other cases in which Belarusian individuals were allegedly murdered for political reasons, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nOn November 28, 2003, a district court in Minsk declared Zavadsky officially dead. Judge Nataliya Andreyeva spent several hours examining evidence presented by the Public Prosecutor's Office that the ORT cameraman had died after his abduction and then officially changed Zavadsky's status from missing to dead.\n\n\"This was done for property-related reasons so that my apartment can be registered in my name,\" Zavadskaya told CPJ. \"I still want to find out the truth about my husband and what happened to him.\"\n\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office ended its investigation into the Zavadsky case in January 2003, claiming they had pursued all available leads in the cameraman's disappearance.\n\nOn December 10, 2003, prosecutors announced they had reopened the investigation about 48 hours before the Council of Europe, a pan-Europe human rights monitoring organization, released a report alleging that high-level government officials were involved in the journalist's disappearance and its subsequent cover-up.\n\nHowever, Ivan Branchel, deputy head of the prosecutor's Organized Crime and Corruption Department, sent a letter to Zavadskaya in early April 2004 informing her that the case was closed on March 31, 2004, said the Minsk-based human rights group Charter 97.\n\nAuthorities have refused to give Zavadskaya information about the investigation, which relatives of victims are authorized to obtain under Belarus law, said Zavadskaya."},{"id":1039,"location":"Brazil","year":"2003","name":"Luiz Antônio da Costa","organization":"Época","date":"July 23, 2003","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"São Bernardo do Campo","job":"Photographer","medium":"Print","coverage":"Human Rights","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Da Costa, a photographer with the weekly Época, was killed while on assignment in the city of São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo State.\n\nThe 36-year-old photographer, who was known professionally as La Costa, and Época reporter Alexandre Mansur were covering the occupation by homeless families of an empty lot belonging to a Volkswagen auto factory in São Bernardo do Campo.

When Rivas exited his car, an unidentified gunman shot him in the head and fled.The police suspect that several accomplices were waiting for the hit man in a car, according to the Tegucigalpa daily El Heraldo. Police are pursuing several possible motives in the investigation, including that Rivas was killed for his journalistic work. Authorities have identified three individuals who allegedly committed the murder, but arrest warrants for the suspects have not yet been issued, the Tegucigalpa daily La Prensa reported.In addition to his duties as owner of Corporación Maya Visión, Rivas was the director of the daily news program \"CMV Noticias\" (CMV News). The program, which is broadcast between 6 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., also airs on radio station Estéreo Maya Visión, which Rivas and his wife own.Before he was murdered, Rivas survived a shooting on February 24. That evening, unidentified assailants attacked the journalist outside his house when he arrived home after finishing his station's daily news program, he told CPJ after the incident. When Rivas exited the car to open the garage door, the attacker, who was hidden, fired a single shot and fled. The shot missed Rivas, hitting the pavement. Rivas then went into his house and called the police, who arrived about 20 minutes later. Officers examined the area but left soon because it became too dark to search. Two people, including a neighborhood guard, witnessed the attack.The next day, Rivas and the neighborhood guard looked for evidence, found a gun that appeared to have been used in the shooting, and turned it over to police. Officers told Rivas it was a .30-caliber weapon. They sent it to a lab in the capital, Tegucigalpa, for ballistic tests. The test results were never announced, and the weapon used in the attack remains in a Tegucigalpa lab.The journalist told CPJ he believed that the attack was linked to his journalistic work and cited several sensitive stories that his station had covered. In September 2002, the station's investigative journalism team reported on the smuggling of coffee and cattle from Honduras to Guatemala. (The segment was dropped in December 2002 after the sponsor canceled its contract.) The station has also extensively covered local neighborhood associations that have denounced a local mining company for spilling cyanide into Copán Department's Lara River. The night of the February attack, Rivas said, the station reported that the Honduran government had ordered the mining company to pay a fine of 1 million lempiras (US$60,000).Félix Molina, deputy coordinator of the Honduran freedom of expression organization Comité para la Libertad de Expresión, said that although the station's crime reporting was not very aggressive, the fact that it covered crime at all could have provoked retaliation.Rivas, who said he had no enemies, did not have any particular suspects for the February shooting.

Taras Protsyuk, a Ukrainian cameraman for Reuters, was also killed in the attack\n\nAgence France-Presse reported that Couso was hit in his jaw and right leg. He was taken to Saint Raphael Hospital, where he died during surgery. Couso was married with two children.\n\nDirectly after the attack, Maj. Gen. Buford Blount, commander of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division, confirmed that a single shell had been fired at the hotel from a tank in response to what he said was rocket and small arms fire from the building. Journalists at the hotel deny that any gunfire had emanated from the building.\n\nA CPJ report concluded that the shelling of the hotel, while not deliberate, was avoidable since U.S. commanders knew that journalists were present in the hotel and were intent on not hitting it.

Dana\nwas struck in the torso while filming near Abu Ghraib Prison, outside\nBaghdad, in the afternoon. He had been reporting with a colleague near\nthe prison after a mortar attack had killed six Iraqis there the\nprevious night. The soldier in the tank who fired on Dana did so\nwithout warning, while the journalist filmed the vehicle approaching\nhim from about 55 yards (50 meters).\n\nU.S. military officials said the soldier who opened fire mistook Dana's\ncamera for a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher. There was no\nfighting taking place in the area, and the journalists had been\noperating in the vicinity of the prison with the knowledge of U.S.\ntroops near the prison gates.\n\nIn an August 18 letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld,\nCPJ protested the shooting, stating that it raised \"serious questions\nabout the conduct of U.S. troops and their rules of engagement.\"\n\nOn September 22, the U.S. military announced that it had concluded its\ninvestigation into the incident. A spokesman for U.S. Central Command\n(Centcom) in Iraq told CPJ that while Dana's killing was \"regrettable,\"\nthe soldier \"acted within the rules of engagement.\" No further details\nwere provided. The results of the investigation have not been made\npublic. A Centcom spokesman said other details of the report are\nclassified.\n\nDana's soundman, Nael Shyioukhi, who witnessed the incident, told CPJ\nthat he and Dana arrived at the prison with their driver, Munzer Abbas,\nin the late afternoon. According to Shyioukhi, several journalists were\nalso in the area. Shyioukhi said that after a short while Dana\nsuggested that they approach the prison gates to begin filming. At one\npoint, Dana identified himself to a U.S. soldier as a journalist from\nReuters and asked if a spokesman was available to comment on camera\nabout the attack the previous night. The soldier replied that he could\nnot comment, and no spokesmen were available. Dana then asked the\nsoldier if he and Shyioukhi could film the prison from a nearby bridge.\nAccording to Shyioukhi, the soldier politely told them they were\nwelcome to do so.\n\nAfter filming from the bridge, located between 330 and 660 yards (300\nand 600 meters) from the prison, Dana and Shyioukhi, who were wearing\njeans and T-shirts, packed their equipment in their car and began to\nhead off for the Reuters office. As they approached the main road to\nthe prison, Dana noticed a convoy of tanks approaching and told Abbas\nto stop so he could film it. According to Shyioukhi, he and Dana were\nnot apprehensive because the area was calm, and it was apparent that\nU.S. troops were in complete control. Neither Dana nor Shyioukhi were\nwearing flak jackets, and their car was not marked press.\n\nDana exited the car and set up his blue, canvas-encased camera with a\nwhite microphone facing the tanks while Shyioukhi lit a cigarette.\nShyioukhi said Dana filmed for about 10 seconds, when suddenly, without\nwarning, several shots rang out from the lead tank, which was\napproximately 55 yards (50 meters) away.\n\nShyioukhi ducked for cover then heard Dana scream and place his hand on\nhis stomach, which was bleeding profusely. He said that within moments\nof the shooting, approximately six U.S. soldiers, including the one who\nshot Dana, surrounded them. Shyioukhi recounted that the soldier who\nshot Dana screamed at Shyioukhi to \"stand back.\"\n\nA doctor arrived on an armored personnel carrier (APC) after about 10\nminutes and tried to stop the bleeding. The APC took Dana back to the\nprison complex for treatment and to get him evacuated to a hospital.\n\nU.S. military spokesman Col. Guy Shields called Dana's death a \"tragic\nincident\" and promised to do everything to avoid a similar incident in\nthe future. When questioned by London's Independent\nabout the rules of engagement for U.S. troops, Shields said, \"I can't\ngive you details on the rules of engagement, but the enemy is not in\nformations, they are not wearing uniforms. During wartime firing a\nwarning shot is not a necessity. There is no time for a warning shot if\nthere is potential for an ambush.\"\n\nSome journalists at the scene questioned how troops could mistake the\ncamera for a weapon. And according to experts who train war\ncorrespondents, although one might easily mistake a camera for an RPG\nlauncher at a distance, a camera would be clearly visible from 55 to\n110 yards (50 to 100 meters)-the distance at which Dana was hit."},{"id":1151,"location":"Iraq","year":"2003","name":"Michael Kelly","organization":"Atlantic monthly and the washington post","date":"April 3, 2003","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"outside of Baghdad","job":"Columnist / Commentator, Editor","medium":"Print","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Kelly, editor-at-large of the Atlantic Monthly and a columnist with The Washington Post, was killed while traveling with the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division just south of the Baghdad airport, according to a statement from The Washington Post.\n\nAccording to press reports, when the humvee in which Kelly was riding came under Iraqi fire, the soldier driving the vehicle tried to evade the attack, and the jeep ran off the road and rolled into a canal.

Talk show host and producer Maher Abdullah, a\nfive-year Al-Jazeera veteran who had been in Baghdad for two weeks at\nthe time, told CPJ that planes began flying low in the area at around 6\na.m.\n\nThe crew went up to the roof of the building to report but retreated\nbecause they deemed it unsafe. According to Abdullah, the crew realized\nmoments later that their still camera had been knocked out of position\nand now faced the Ministry of Information building, which Iraqi\nauthorities had explicitly warned the crew not to film. Assistant\ncameraman Zoheir Nadhim returned to the roof with Ayyoub to adjust the\ncamera.\n\nWhen Ayyoub and Nadhim went up stairs, Abdullah heard a plane fly so\nlow it that sounded like it was going to crash into the building. At\nthat point, a missile struck Al-Jazeera's small generator, which was\nlocated outside the building at ground level just below where Ayyoub\nwas believed to have been at the time. Two Al-Jazeera correspondents\nsaid that while they suspect that the strike caused his death, he could\nhave been killed by other ordnance.\n\nAnother plane passed low about 15 minutes later and fired another\nmissile, which struck across the road about 50 feet (15 meters) from\nthe front door, blowing it off the hinges, according to Abdullah.\n\nRaed Khattar, a cameraman for Abu Dhabi TV who, at the time, was\noutside on the nearby roof of Abu Dhabi TV's office, saw what was\nlikely the first missile because his office was between the plane and\nAl-Jazeera's office, he told CPJ.\nMoments later, Abu Dhabi TV staff on the roof came\nunder machine gun fire from a U.S. tank on the nearby Jumhuriyya\nBridge, and one of their three unmanned cameras was struck by a shell,\nstaff told CPJ. The three-story building was marked with a large banner\nlabeled \"Abu Dhabi TV.\"\n\nIn a statement issued hours after the incident, Centcom in Doha, Qatar,\nsaid that, \"According to commanders on the ground, Coalition forces\ncame under significant enemy fire from the building where the\nAl-Jazeera journalists were working and consistent with the right of\nself-defense, Coalition forces returned fire. Sadly an Al-Jazeera\ncorrespondent was killed in this exchange.\"\n\nAbdullah noted that until that morning anti-aircraft fire in the area\nhad been sporadic. Days before April 8, Abdullah saw manned Iraqi\nanti-aircraft positions in the general vicinity-some 220 yards (200\nmeters) away on the opposite side of the generator, but not immediately\nnear the office. However, on April 11, he discovered one abandoned\nanti-aircraft gun about 44 yards (40 meters) away from the bureau.\nJournalists from Abu Dhabi TV told CPJ that Al-Jazeera's bureau was\nlocated near a villa used by former Iraqi Information Minister Muhammad\nSaid Sahhaf.\n\nJust before the war, CPJ obtained a copy of the February 24, 2003,\nletter that then Al-Jazeera Managing Director Mohammed Jasem al-Ali had\nsent to the Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke specifying the\ncoordinates of the bureau.\n\nAl-Jazeera also maintains that the night before the strike, al-Ali had\nreceived explicit assurances from U.S. State Department official Nabeel\nKhoury in Doha, Qatar, that the bureau was safe and would not be\ntargeted. Abdullah told CPJ, \"The coordinates were actually given four\nmonths in advance to the Pentagon, and we were assured that we would\nnot be hit under any circumstances. ... We would never be targeted,\nthat was the assurance.\"\n\nIn an e-mail reply to CPJ, Khoury, who said he did not recall the exact\ndate of his meeting with Al-Jazeera, said, \"I doubt very much that I\nassured anybody's safety in a war zone.\" He added that he did tell the\nstation \"what we had been telling all diplomats and civilians, that\nwhereas our troops would do their utmost not to hurt civilians, there\nwas no way to guarantee anyone's safety in a war zone.\"\n\nIn its April 8 letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld CPJ\nalso noted that, \"The attack against Al-Jazeera is of particular\nconcern since the stations' offices were also hit in Kabul,\nAfghanistan, in November 2001. The Pentagon asserted, without providing\nadditional detail, that the office was a 'known Al-Qaeda facility,' and\nthat the U.S. military did not know the space was being used by\nAl-Jazeera.\"\n\nCPJ is still waiting for the Defense Department to fulfill a Freedom of\nInformation Act request related to the incident that CPJ filed in May."},{"id":1751,"location":"Iraq","year":"2003","name":"Terry Lloyd","organization":"Itv news","date":"March 22, 2003","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"near Al-Zubayr","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Television","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Lloyd, a veteran correspondent with ITV News, was confirmed dead on March 23 by the British TV network ITN, which produces ITV News. The previous day, he had disappeared after coming under fire while driving to the southern Iraqi city of Basra.\n\nTwo others disappeared with Lloyd, cameraman Fred Nerac and translator Hussein Othman. They remain missing.\n\nThe three men, along with cameraman Daniel Demoustier, were traveling in two marked press vehicles in the town of Iman Anas, near Al-Zubayr, when they came under fire, ITN reported. According to Demoustier, the car he and Lloyd had been driving had been pursued by Iraqi troops who may have been attempting to surrender to the journalists. Demoustier reported that the incoming fire to their vehicles likely came from U.S. or British forces in the area.\n\nDemoustier, who was injured when the car he was driving crashed into a ditch and caught fire, managed to escape. He said he did not see what happened to Lloyd, who was seated next to him, or to the other crew members. Lloyd's body was recovered in a hospital in Basra days later.\n\nAn investigative article published in The Wall Street Journal in May indicated that Lloyd's SUV and another vehicle belonging to his colleagues came under fire from U.S. Marines. The article cited accounts from U.S. troops who recalled opening fire on cars marked \"TV.\" Soldiers also said they believed that Iraqi suicide bombers were using the cars to attack U.S. troops.\n\nThe Journal article cited a report from a British security firm commissioned by ITN to investigate the incident saying that Lloyd's car was hit by both coalition and Iraqi fire;the latter most likely came from behind the car, possibly after the vehicle had crashed.\n\nThe report concluded that \"[t]he Iraqis no doubt mounted an attack using the ITN crew as cover, or perhaps stumbled into the U.S. forces whilst attempting to detain the ITN crew.\" The report also speculated that the missing men-Nerac and Othman, who were last seen by Demoustier in another car being stopped by Iraqi forces-might have been pulled out of their car before it came under fire from coalition forces, and then Iraqi forces used the SUV to attack the coalition forces.\n\nIn April, Nerac's wife approached U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell at a NATO press conference, and he promised to do everything in his power to find out what had happened to the missing men. In late May, Centcom said that it was investigating the incident, while the British Ministry of Defense promised to open an inquiry. Neither had made public any results as of October.\n\nIn September, London's The Daily Mirror newspaper reported the testimony of an Iraqi man named Hamid Aglan who had allegedly tried to rescue the wounded Lloyd in a civilian minibus. Aglan told the newspaper that he had picked up a lightly wounded Lloyd, who had suffered only a shoulder injury, and attempted to take him to a hospital in Basra when the minibus came under fire from a U.S. helicopter, killing Lloyd. The paper reported that the bus was also carrying wounded Iraqi soldiers.\n\nAn ITN spokesperson told CPJ that a number of elements of Aglan's story are not consistent with ITN's own investigation. She said an autopsy revealed that Lloyd had suffered two serious wounds that likely resulted from Iraqi and U.S. fire. She said that after he was wounded, an Iraqi civilian in a minibus had picked up Lloyd and tried to take him to a hospital in Basra. The minibus later came under U.S. attack. \"It was a gunshot to the bus and [Terry] was probably in the bus,\" she said. ITN investigators believe that either wound that Lloyd sustained would have been fatal."},{"id":812,"location":"Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory","year":"2003","name":"James Miller","organization":"Freelance","date":"May 2, 2003","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Rafah","job":"Camera Operator","medium":"Television","coverage":"Human Rights, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Miller, a British freelance cameraman and film director with U.K.-based\nFrostbite Films, was fatally shot in the Gaza Strip.

Miller, his producer Saira Shah, and translator Abdul\nRahman Abdullah attempted to identify themselves to the Israeli troops\nin the area while they were leaving. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF)\ntroops were in armored personnel carriers (APCs) about 330 feet (100\nmeters) away from the house where the journalists had been filming.\n\nThe journalists were wearing jackets and helmets marked \"TV.\" Abdullah\nwaved a white flag while Miller used a flashlight to illuminate the\nflag. As they approached the APCs, the journalists shouted \"Hello,\" and\nthen a shot was fired. The journalists yelled that they were British\njournalists, and a second shot was fired immediately after. In video\nfootage of the incident, it appears that that the second shot hit\nMiller, who was struck in the neck.

Clashes broke out in several locations near the city's center, involving youths throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli troops. Some Palestinian gunmen were also observed firing guns, according to press accounts.\n\nAt the time that Darwazeh was shot, he had been filming an Israeli tank stranded at the corner of an alleyway. Darwazeh and several other Palestinian journalists were standing by a door in the alleyway. A few minutes before Darwazeh was killed, Reuters cameraman Hassan Titi filmed a group of Palestinian youths running down the alley away from the stranded tank. Titi and Reuters photographer Abed Qusini, who were standing near Darwazeh, said that an Israeli soldier crouched under the tank and quickly fired a single shot at the journalists from a distance of about 11 to 22 yards (10 or 20 meters). Darwazeh was struck in the back of the head and died instantly.\n\nTiti and Qusini said there were no clashes or gunfire in the alley at the time, although there had been some Palestinian gunfire in the vicinity earlier. The AP reported that gunfire may have struck near the tank at around the same time, but that it likely came from a different direction from where Darwazeh was standing.\n\nMaj.

Based on the circumstances and secrecy surrounding Shchekochikhin's death, and the dangerous subject he was investigating at the time, CPJ also believes there is sufficient reason for launching a murder probe. The Prosecutor General's Office has repeatedly denied Novaya Gazeta's requests to open a murder investigation into Shchekochikhin's death, citing lack of foul play evidence.\n\nShchekochikhin worked for Novaya Gazeta since 1996, covering dangerous assignments such as the Chechen conflict, high-powered corruption, arms trade, and organized crime. From 2001 until his sudden death in 2003, he had published a series of detailed investigative reports on a smuggling and corruption case that involved a Moscow furniture store known as Tri Kita (Three Whales). As a member of Russia's parliament, Shchekochikhin interviewed officials and gained access to documents related to the case.\n\nWhile the Tri Kita case seemed like a regular business fraud case- the store had smuggled European furniture without paying taxes and customs fees-it involved high-ranking FSB officials who were found to have used the furniture business to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through the Bank of New York in the late '90s.\n\nIn a February 18, 2002, lengthy article for Novaya Gazeta, Shchekochikhin revealed evidence that the Prosecutor General's Office had received US$2 million in bribes in order to stop a Tri Kita corruption investigation.\n\nFollowing its publication, Shchekochikhin received threats but continued investigating. In March 2002, as deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Security, he helped launch a parliamentary probe into the Tri Kita case. The probe was rejected by then Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov who refused to re-open the Tri Kita case, citing lack of evidence of criminal activity.\n\nIn April 2002 Shchekochikhin wrote President Vladimir Putin to request he take the case under his personal control. President Putin responded positively, but as of June 2003 the case had gone nowhere. On June 2, 2003, Shchekochikhin published another detailed article on the Tri Kita affair-his last one. Exactly a month after the material appeared in Novaya Gazeta, Shchekochikhin was dead.\n\nThe June 2 piece criticized the corruption in Russia's law enforcement. The piece followed up the May 27, 2003, assassination of a key witness in the Tri Kita case. The witness, Sergei Pereverzev, then president of Russia's Furniture Business Association and a former navy captain, had received threats ahead of his court testimony and had publicly said he feared for his life, Shcheckochikhin wrote. On May 14, Pereverzev was injured in a car crash and taken to a Moscow military hospital. Thirteen days later, he was assassinated by a gunman who had somehow managed to penetrate the heavily guarded neurosurgical ward.\n\nExactly one month after the piece was published, Shchekochikhin was dead-victim of an \"unknown allergen\" that caused organs failure.\n\nOn June 17, 2003, while on a business trip in the city of Ryazan, 200 kilometers (120 miles) south-east of Moscow, Shchekochikhin suddenly felt sick with flu-like symptoms. He returned to Moscow that day with a fever, sore throat, body aches, and a burning sensation all over his skin, Novaya Gazeta reported. The next day, a doctor diagnosed him with an acute respiratory viral infection. But Shchekochikhin's health rapidly deteriorated in the next few days and he was hospitalized on June 21. In the next 12 days, the journalist's organs failed one by one-his skin literally peeled off his body; he lost all of his hair; his lungs, liver, kidneys, and, finally, his brain stopped functioning.\n\nDoctors said Shchekochikhin's symptoms were consistent with the Lyell's Syndrome-a severe allergic reaction to medications or infections, Novaya Gazeta said. But the allergen that caused the reaction was never identified. Moreover, Shchekochikhin's clinical test results were classified as \"medical secret.\" Moscow Central Clinical Hospital authorities have refused family and colleagues access to those.\n\nWithout clinical test results, the Prosecutor General's Office says there is no evidence of foul play and refuses to open a murder case into Shchekochikhin's death. Medical authorities, in turn, say they can only grant access to Shchekochikhin's file if prosecutors need to use it as evidence in a criminal investigation, according to a Novaya Gazeta article from January 15, 2007.\n\nA month before his death, Shchekochikhin had met with officials from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), and had obtained an American visa. He was to travel to the United States to discuss the Bank of New York, money-laundering, connection in the Tri Kita case, according to local and international press reports.

He greeted Gardner, saying in Arabic \"Peace be upon you,\" to which Gardner replied with the traditional \"And upon you the peace and mercy of God and his blessings.\" The man hesitated a moment, pulled out a pistol, and began to fire.\nGardner wrote that he tried to run away, but was hit in the shoulder. A second round struck him in the leg and he fell to the ground in front of a second group of gunmen who were inside a minivan and had opened fire on him. One of the shooters then rifled through his pockets before the group left the scene. Gardner wrote that he lay bleeding on the ground for more than a half-hour before police drove him to a hospital.\nIn a meeting in 2005, Saudi detectives told Gardner that Cumbers died as he got into the van to try and escape, Gardner wrote in his book. News reports said Cumbers was shot in the head. The detectives said that the driver and the government minder survived.\nThe Saudi detectives told Gardner that six gunmen had undertaken the operation, according to the book. The detectives said that members of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were headed to meet Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, the head of the group, in the Al-Suwaidi neighborhood when they spotted the TV crew. The detectives said that al-Muqrin gave the order to kill the journalists.\nThe detectives told Gardner that the gunman who first shot him was named Abdullah al-Subaei, but that it was Faisal al-Dakheel, a senior member of the group, who fired again at Gardner from the minivan.\nAl-Muqrin and al-Dakheel were killed in a shootout with security forces on June 18, 2004, in Al-Suwaidi, according to news reports. At least three other expatriates were killed in the 12 days between Cumbers' murder and the shootout, according to Jihad in Saudi Arabia, a 2010 book written by scholar Thomas Heghammer. Three of the other assailants were also killed in clashes with security forces.\nThe sixth member of the attackers, Adel al-Dhubaiti, was arrested in 2005, Gardner told CPJ. In the 2005 meeting with Gardner, the Saudi detectives told him that al-Dhubaiti was the gunman who shot Cumbers.\nOn November 18, 2014, the Saudi Specialized Criminal Court sentenced al-Dhubaiti to death for his role in multiple Al-Qaeda attacks, including the murder of Cumbers, according to news reports. Two other defendants, members of Al-Qaeda, were sentenced to death and five others were sentenced to up to 30 years' imprisonment, the reports said.\nThe Saudi embassy in the United States and the Saudi Ministry of Justice did not respond to CPJ's requests in late 2014 for comment. Gardner told CPJ in an email shortly after the sentence that the Saudi government had provided him and the Cumbers family with \"absolutely ZERO information about the trial.\" He added that the Saudi government had never apologized nor paid any compensation to his or Cumbers' family for what he said was Saudi incompetence in both ensuring security for the crew and handling the aftermath of the shooting.\nCumbers' father, Robert, said in a statement after the November 2014 sentencing that he had \"mixed feelings\" about the issuing of a death sentence. He said he was relieved the wait was over but expressed sympathy to Al-Dhubaiti's parents.\nOn January 2, 2016, the Saudi Ministry of Interior said in a statement it had executed 47 prisoners, including al-Dhubaiti. The list of executed prisoners mostly included those accused of carrying out attacks on behalf of Al-Qaeda."},{"id":130,"location":"Sri Lanka","year":"2004","name":"Aiyathurai Nadesan","organization":"Virakesari","date":"May 31, 2004","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Batticaloa","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Corruption, Human Rights, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Nadesan, a veteran Tamil journalist with the national Tamil-language \ndaily Virakesari, was shot by unidentified assailants in Batticaloa, \na town on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka about 135 miles (216 kilometers) \nfrom the capital, Colombo, according to international news reports \nand local journalists.\n\nNadesan, who had worked at Virakesari for 20 years, was on \nhis way to work when he was ambushed near a Hindu temple.

The Interfax news agency, citing police, said Politkovskaya had been shot and that a pistol and four bullet casings had been found.\nPolitkovskaya, special correspondent for the independent Moscow newspaper Novaya Gazeta, was well known for her investigative reports on human rights abuses by the Russian military in Chechnya. In seven years covering the second Chechen war, Politkovskaya's reporting repeatedly drew the wrath of Russian authorities. She was threatened, jailed, forced into exile, and poisoned during her career, CPJ research shows.\nIgor Korolkov, a colleague, told the Regnum news website that Politkovskaya had been reporting on alleged torture in Chechnya.\nCPJ had named Politkovskaya one of the world's top press freedom figures of the past 25 years in the fall 2006 edition of its magazine, Dangerous Assignments. In an interview for that profile, Politkovskaya noted the government's obstruction and harassment of journalists trying to cover the Chechen conflict and pointed to the deadly 2004 hostage crisis in the North Ossetian town of Beslan. \"There is so much more to write about Beslan,\" she told CPJ, \"but it gets more and more difficult when all the journalists who write are forced to leave.\"\nPolitkovskaya was poisoned on her way to cover the Beslan crisis. After drinking tea on a flight to the region, she became seriously ill and was hospitalized--but the toxin was never identified because the medical staff was instructed to destroy her blood tests.\nPolitkovskaya had been threatened and attacked numerous times in retaliation for her work. In February 2001, CPJ research shows, security agents detained her in the Vedeno district in Chechnya, accusing her of entering Chechnya without accreditation. She was kept in a pit for three days without food or water, while a military officer threatened to shoot her. Seven months later, she received death threats from a military officer accused of crimes against civilians. She was forced to flee to Vienna after the officer sent an e-mail to Novaya Gazeta promising that he would seek revenge.\nWhen Politkovskaya covertly visited Chechnya in 2002 to investigate new allegations of human rights abuses, CPJ research shows, security officers arrested her, kept her overnight at a military base, and threatened her. In October of that year, Politkovskaya served as a mediator between armed Chechen fighters and Russian forces during a hostage standoff in a central Moscow theater. Two days into the crisis, with the Kremlin restricting media coverage, Russian forces gassed the theater and 129 hostages died. Politkovskaya delivered some of the most compelling accounts of the tragedy.\nIn 2009, a Moscow jury acquitted three suspected conspirators, the brothers Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov and former Moscow police officer Sergei Khadzhikurbanov. Another Makhmudov brother, Rustam, whom authorities identified as the gunman, was at large at the time. Investigators acknowledged they had rushed a poorly prepared case to trial. An appellate court later granted a re-trial.\nThe case moved forward again in 2012, when prosecutors indicted Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, a retired police lieutenant colonel, on charges that he helped orchestrate the murder. Authorities accused Pavlyuchenkov, head of surveillance for Moscow's main police force in 2006, of ordering subordinates to follow Politkovskaya and determine her schedule and usual travel routes. The information was then passed along to the gang hired to kill the journalist, prosecutors said.\nIn December 2012, Pavlyuchenkov was sentenced to 11 years in prison on charges that he was an accomplice in the plot. Family and colleagues were dismayed by the ruling, which came after a closed proceeding; lawyers for Politkovskaya's family said they would appeal. Colleagues and relatives had hoped Pavlyuchenkov would identify the masterminds in open court.\nFollowing the verdict, investigators said they considered exiled tycoon Boris Berezovsky and Chechen envoy Akhmed Zakayev to be the masterminds--an assertion dismissed by Politkovskaya's representatives as unfounded and politically motivated.\nFive other suspects were in detention in late 2012, including all three Makhmudov brothers, former officer Khadzhikurbanov, and Chechen underground leader Lom-Ali Gaitukayev. Prosecutors said Gaitukayev served as the main organizer and liaison between the masterminds and Pavlyuchenkov.\nOn May 20, 2014, a Moscow City Court jury found the five defendants guilty of planning, participating, and carrying out Politkovskaya's murder, local and international press reported. On July 9, 2014, the court sentenced Rustam Makhmudov, the convicted gunman, and Gaitukayev, the organizer of the crime, to life terms in prison. Two other Makhmudov brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim, convicted as the gunman's driver and lookout, received 14- and 12-year jail terms, respectively. Convicted as an accomplice to the murder, Khadzhikurbanov received 20 years in prison. No one was tried as the suspected mastermind.\nAnna Stavitskaya, lawyer for Politkovskaya's adult children, told CPJ, \"My clients, Ilya and Vera Politkovsky, are convinced that the men sentenced indeed bear responsibility in the murder. But they are also convinced that the crime is far from being fully solved.\" Frustrated with the course of the investigation, the journalist's family applied to the European Court of Human Rights, which could intervene if it concluded local authorities did not carry out a proper inquiry.\nOn June 24, 2014, the Moscow City Court said it would hear Pavlyuchenkov's appeal to postpone the start of his prison term because of alleged health problems, including mental health issues. (Pavlyuchenkov was being held in a detention facility pending appeals.) A court scheduled a hearing for his case on August 18, 2014.\nStavitskaya told the Russian service of the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the family believed there were no grounds for postponing Pavlyuchenkov's sentence. \"There are many people who appeal for release or postponement of their terms in connection with their health conditions,\" she said. \"But their appeals are routinely rejected by the courts, even though oftentimes the crimes they are convicted of are of economic nature. Pavlyuchenkov was convicted of murder. He admitted his guilt and has been under arrest for a long time now. There are no reasons to believe that he cannot continue to be under arrest.\"\nPolitkovskaya's former colleagues at Novaya Gazeta said Pavlyuchenkov knew much more about the murder than he had revealed. They said the investigating authorities were aware of this but had not pressed him to speak. They said the official investigation was lacking in other ways as well: They said it had become clear a number of officers with the police's elite secret department and the Federal Security Service (FSB) played roles in the murder, but none of the officers were brought to justice.\nKarinna Moskalenko, one of the Politkovskaya family lawyers, said she was skeptical about the 2014 verdicts and sentencing. \"The life terms given to two secondary culprits in the murder,\" Moskalenko told CPJ, \"are an attempt to avert the international attention away from the case, and from the fact that Anna Politkovskaya's killing remains unsolved.\""},{"id":757,"location":"Russia","year":"2006","name":"Ilya Zimin","organization":"Ntv","date":"February 26, 2006","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Moscow","freelance":"No","description":"Zimin, 33, a correspondent for the national television station NTV, was found murdered in his Moscow apartment.

A month later, police found his car parked near a local hotel. Maksimov's mobile phone without its SIM card resurfaced at a local flea market at about the same time, according to local press reports.\n\n Investigators and colleagues did not initially focus on Maksimov's journalism as a reason for his disappearance. At the time, Maksimov was seeking to trade his apartment in downtown St. Petersburg for a bigger one. Colleagues believed that he might have fallen victim to the organized crime gangs that control the real estate market in St. Petersburg, the news Web site Gazeta reported.\n\n For an entire year after the disappearance, police and prosecutors did not report any developments in the investigation. In June 2005, several Russian newspapers reported on the detention of at least three police officers--all senior investigators in the corruption division of the Northwestern Federal District's Interior Ministry. The three were said to be suspects in Maksimov's disappearance and suspected murder.\n\n The initial report came from the news agency Interfax and cited an anonymous source in the Northwestern Federal District's Prosecutor-General's Office. The report said that investigators believed that Maksimov was murdered for his work as a journalist and that two majors and a lieutenant colonel were considered suspects.\n\n The suspects, Kommersant said, were held on unrelated criminal charges of forgery and falsifying evidence. The English-language daily Moscow Times said that St. Petersburg police confirmed the Interfax report but refused to give further details.\n\n Soon after those reports appeared, however, on June 30, 2005, the Northwestern Federal District's Interior Ministry issued a statement denying the involvement of the three police investigators in Maksimov's disappearance. The Interior Ministry said it \"considers inadmissible and premature the appearance of press reports, accusing [the officers] of masterminding the murder of journalist Maksim Maksimov.\" The Interior Ministry gave no information on how the investigation was developing. The statement generated no follow-up by the authorities.\n\n In the absence of official information, speculation about what could have happened to Maksimov continued to circulate in the Russian press.\n\n The St. Petersburg newspaper Smena, where Maksimov worked before joining Gorod, said on June 27, 2005, that it learned from unnamed sources in the St. Petersburg branch of the Interior Ministry that Maksimov disappeared was targeted by high-ranking officers in retaliation for the journalist's investigation of corruption in the local Interior Ministry. The paper said that the perpetrators, three masterminds and two executors, were in detention.\n\nKommersant carried a similar story the next day. The paper said investigators believed Maksimov was strangled to death to prevent him from reporting on corruption in the St. Petersburg branch of the Interior Ministry. Several newspapers described in detail what they said happened to Maksimov the day he disappeared, and how he had been killed, but they did not attribute their accounts or explain how they had received the information.\n\n Other reports noted that Maksimov had investigated the murders of several Russian businessmen and politicians, including Galina Starovoytova, a parliamentary deputy shot in her apartment building in 1998.\n\n Authorities have not disclosed further information on the investigation, the identities of anyone held in connection with the crime, or the status of any criminal case. The journalist's body has not been found.\n\n Rimma Maksimova, Maksim Maksimov's mother, described her communication with prosecutors in charge of the investigation as \"difficult.\" Maksimova told CPJ that she had received no answer to queries she sent to the Northwestern Federal District's prosecutor-general's office and the Northwestern Federal District's Interior Ministry in St. Petersburg.\n\n On November 24, 2006, Maksimova met with St. Petersburg Gov. Valentina Matvienko who assured her that solving Maksimov's case was a priority for St. Petersburg's administration. But the meeting did not result in any developments, and Maksimova told CPJ that authorities stopped answering her queries."},{"id":1787,"location":"Russia","year":"2006","name":"Vagif Kochetkov","organization":"Trud and tulsky molodoi kommunar","date":"January 8, 2006","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Tula","job":"Columnist / Commentator, Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Business, Culture, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Unknown Fire","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Kochetkov, 31, a reporter in Tula, 125 miles (200 kilometers) south of\nMoscow, died in the Tula city hospital after undergoing surgery for a\nserious head injury he sustained in an attack two weeks before,\naccording to CPJ interviews and local press reports.\n\n            Kochetkov was Tula correspondent for the Moscow daily Trud and a columnist for the local newspaper Tulsky Molodoi Kommunar, reporting on politics, social issues, and culture.\n\nAt least one assailant struck Kochetkov on the head with a blunt object\nand robbed him of a bag and cell phone as he approached his home in\nTula on the evening of December 27, 2005, sources told CPJ. The bag was\nbelieved to have contained Kochetkov's passport, press card, credit\ncard, and work-related documents. The attackers did not take\nKochetkov's money or an expensive fur coat he was wearing. When a\nneighbor found Kochetkov's bag in her apartment building's basement,\nthe bag contained everything but the documents related to Kochetkov's\nwork, according to CPJ interviews with Kochetkov's parents, Valentina\nand Yuri, and Lena Shuletova, a friend and colleague.\n\nOn the night of the attack, the news agency ANN reported, Kochetkov\ntold his parents he was meeting an unidentified person, after which he\nwould return home to download his work onto his computer. That evening,\nValentina and Yuri Kochetkov told CPJ, the journalist called from a\nlocal coffee shop and told them that he'd be home in an hour. On the\nway, he was attacked.\n\nTwo neighbors found Kochetkov lying unconscious on the ground at around\n2 a.m. on December 28. After regaining consciousness, Kochetkov walked\nhome with the help of neighbors. He did not seek immediate medical\nattention or report the attack to the police.\n\nKochetkov was not admitted to the hospital until the next day, when\ndoctors diagnosed him with two hematomas and said his condition was not\nlife-threatening, Yuri Kochetkov told CPJ. Kochetkov's health began\ndeteriorating January 1. He underwent brain surgery on January 5 and\nfell into a coma and died three days later. An autopsy showed Kochetkov\nhad suffered a skull fracture, a concussion, multiple chest bruises,\nand other head injuries, according to press reports and CPJ interviews.\nKochetkov never identified his attackers.\n\nThe Kochetkovs reported the attack on January 7, and police opened a\ncriminal investigation, the parents told CPJ. By January 9, police said\nthat they had identified a suspect.\n\nOn April 3, Tula prosecutors announced they had completed their\ninvestigation and determined Kochetkov's death to be the result of a\nrobbery. That same day, prosecutors filed robbery and manslaughter\ncharges against Yan Stakhanov, a 26-year-old Tula businessman.\n\nPolice did not focus on Kochetkov's work as a motive. Investigators did\nnot question colleagues about Kochetkov's recent assignments, nor did\nthey look at the reporter's computer or notebooks for leads. CPJ\nresearch shows that Kochetkov had worked on sensitive issues prior to\nhis murder.\n\n            Just prior to the attack, Kochetkov wrote an article in Trud\non the activities of a Tula drug-dealing group. The December 16 article\nwas headlined, \"Revenge of the Mafia?\" In June 2005, Kochetkov\ncriticized the aggressive business practices of a local pharmaceutical\ncompany in another article.\n\n            Journalists at Tulsky Molodoi Kommunar\nsaid in late March that Kochetkov had received telephone threats in\nretaliation for his reporting, the Moscow-based news Web site Newsinfo\nsaid. Kochetkov's colleagues believed that he had enemies, but they\nsaid he never shared personal information, the Moscow-based news Web\nsite Press-Attache said.\n The trial of\nStakhanov opened on April 17 in the Proletarski district court in Tula.\nAlthough the trial was said to be open, only one journalist at a time\nwas admitted to the hearings. Officials cited lack of space in the\ncourtroom, Valentina and Yuri Kochetkov told CPJ. Before the trial,\nStakhanov allegedly confessed to killing Kochetkov but said later that\nthe confession was coerced, local press reports said. During the trial,\nprosecutors said the assault on Kochetkov was part of a string of\nrobberies in Tula, according to local press reports. The trial was\nrecessed in September without an immediate date to reconvene, colleague\nShuletova said.\n\nYuri Kochetkov told CPJ that he doubted the attack on his son was a\nrobbery, since only work-related documents and a cell phone were taken."},{"id":1876,"location":"Russia","year":"2006","name":"Yevgeny Gerasimenko","organization":"Saratovsky rasklad","date":"July 26, 2006","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Saratov","freelance":"No","description":"Gerasimenko, a correspondent for the independent weekly Saratovsky Rasklad, was found dead in his apartment in Saratov in southeastern Russia, according to local press reports.

But Colussi\ntold CPJ he was not sure whether Barbon named any of the four police officers\nin these stories.\nLawyers for the suspects declined to make a\nstatement when contacted by CPJ, saying they were not able to comment because\nthe case is being tried under secrecy.\nBarbon had worked as a journalist for 10 years, according to\nlocal press reports. In 2003, he drew wide attention with a report on a local\nchild prostitution ring, published in the daily Realidade, which he owned. The report resulted in the convictions\nof four businessmen, five local politicians, and one other person, a waiter,\nthe national newspaper O Globo\nreported. Due to financial difficulties, Barbon shut down Realidade in 2004. He\nran unsuccessfully for city council the same year.\nCátia Rosa Camargo, the journalist's wife, said that her\nhusband had received a constant stream of threatening letters and telephone\ncalls, according to international and Brazilian press reports. Local media\nreported that police advised Camargo and her two children to leave their home\nafter receiving additional threats.In March 2010, a court in Sao Paulo sentenced Avelino and Edson Luiz Ronceiro--both members of \nBrazil's military police--and da Costa to 18 years and four months in prison on \ncharges of aggravated murder and criminal association, the local press reported. \nThe court also convicted Paulo César Ronceiro and gave him 16 \nyears and four months in prison on charges of aggravated murder. Bertoni was to be tried separately.

The trial was marred by allegations of\nirregularities, including charges of inadequate forensic investigation and the\nprosecution's sudden abandonment of theories implicating two soldiers as the\nshooters.

The following narrative is drawn from CPJ interviews with Safronov's Kommersant colleagues and military experts, and from press reports.\nOn the day he died, Safronov talked to colleagues and family by phone and made plans with them for later in the day and for the following week. He visited a Moscow doctor for treatment of an ulcer, symptoms of which had recently abated. Safronov then went grocery shopping and took a trolley back home. Around 4 p.m., two university students living in a nearby apartment building heard a thud and saw Safronov on the ground and an open window in the building above. Safronov's groceries were on the landing between the fourth and the fifth floor of his apartment building. He died before help arrived.\nThe Taganka prosecutor's office in Moscow initially said the death was a suicide. Several days later, prosecutors opened an investigation into what they called \"incitement to suicide,\" a provision of the Russian penal code that is defined as someone provoking a suicide through threats or abusive treatment. In September, prosecutors returned to their initial theory and declared the killing a suicide.\nCPJ research shows Safronov had worked on a number of sensitive issues:\n• In late February, Safronov had returned from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, where he had covered the annual International Defense Exhibition and Conference, a gathering of defense manufacturers. Colleagues said Safronov had called the newsroom from Abu Dhabi with information about a purported Russian sale of fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to Syria and Iran. The sale was said to be channeled through Belarus to conceal the origin. Safronov had planned to finish the story when he returned.\n• Three days before his death, Safronov privately told colleagues at a news conference that he had information about an alleged Russian sale to Syria of the surface-to-air missile system Pantsir-S1, the fighter aircraft MiG-29, and the tactical missile Iskandar-E. He said he had been cautioned not to publish the information because of its international implications, but he did not say who had issued the warning.\n• Safronov had been interrogated many times by state security agents for allegedly disclosing state secrets in his articles. He was never formally charged because he was able to demonstrate that he had relied solely on public sources. In December 2006, Safronov angered authorities when he wrote about the third consecutive launch failure of the Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile.\nRelatives, friends, and colleagues said Safronov had no reason to commit suicide. He had no personal enemies, no debts, and no life-threatening disease. He had been married for many years, had two adult children, and was expecting his first grandchild.

Dink had received numerous death threats from nationalist Turks who viewed his iconoclastic journalism, particularly on the mass killings of Armenians in the early 20th century, as an act of treachery. In a January 10 article in Agos, Dink said he had passed along a particularly threatening letter to Istanbul's Sisli district prosecutor, but no action had been taken.\nPrime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned Dink's murder as an attack against Turkey's unity and promised to catch those responsible, according to international news reports. A day later, police arrested the alleged triggerman, 17-year-old Ogün Samast, who reportedly confessed to the crime. Erhan Tuncel and Yasin Hayal, described as ultranationalist Turks opposed to Dink's political views, were accused of conspiring with Samast to carry out the murder. In all, 19 people went on trial beginning in July.\nIn the last 15 years, 18 other Turkish journalists have been killed for their work, many of them murdered, making it the eighth-deadliest country in the world for journalists, CPJ research shows. The last killing was in 1999. More recently, journalists, academics, and others have been subjected to pervasive legal harassment for statements that allegedly insult the Turkish identity, CPJ research shows.\nDink, a Turkish citizen of Armenian descent, had been prosecuted several times in recent years-for writing about the mass killings of Armenians by Turks at the beginning of the 20th century, for criticizing lines in the Turkish national anthem that he considered discriminatory, and even for commenting publicly on the court cases against him. His office had also been the target of protests.\nIn July 2006, Turkey's High Court of Appeals upheld a six-month suspended prison sentence against Dink for violating Article 301 of the penal code in a case sparked by complaints from nationalist activists. His prosecution stemmed from a series of articles in early 2004 dealing with the collective memory of the Armenian massacres of 1915-17 under the Ottoman Empire. Armenians call the killings the first genocide of the 20th century, a term that Turkey rejects.\nIronically, the pieces for which Dink was convicted had urged diaspora Armenians to let go of their anger against the Turks. The prosecution was sharply criticized by the European Union, which Turkey has sought to join. Dink said he would take the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, to clear his name.\nDink edited Agos for all of the newspaper's 11-year existence.

Yevloyev's relatives, colleagues, and friends told CPJ they believe\nhe was murdered to silence the Web site, one of the few remaining independent\nnews sources in Ingushetia.\nYevloyev had just gotten off a flight from Moscow when he was arrested at about 1:30 p.m., according to a colleague who was\npresent at the scene but asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal.\nYevloyev, who lived in Moscow\nwith his family, was traveling to Ingushetia to visit with his parents and\nfriends. Around 20 relatives and friends had gathered at Magas airport to greet\nYevloyev.\nShortly before leaving the plane, Yevloyev sent a text\nmessage to Magomed Khazbiyev, a friend and local opposition activist, telling\nhim that he had shared the flight with Ingushetia President Murat Zyazikov, the\nfriend told CPJ. After the presidential cortege left the airport, six armored\nvehicles approached the plane, Khazbiyev said. A group of armed police officers\napproached Yevloyev and placed him in a UAZ van. \"They did not handcuff him,\nand he did not resist them,\" Khazbiyev told CPJ.\nThe daily Kommersant reported\nthat Ingushetia police said they had detained Yevloyev as a witness in a\ncriminal investigation into an August explosion at the home of a regional\nadministration official.\nWhen they saw Yevloyev had been detained, Khazbiyev said,\nfriends followed the vehicles in their own cars. After the police vehicles left\nthe airport, they split into two columns and took different directions.\nKhazbiyev and Yevloyev's relatives and friends followed the group heading\ntoward Ingushetia's main city, Nazran. \"We followed them for about 20 minutes\nuntil we almost reached Nazran's city limits,\" Khazbiyev told CPJ. When the\ncars stopped, it became clear Yevloyev was not there. \"We have no blood on our\nhands,\" one police officer told them, Khazbiyev told CPJ.\nIngushetia police said that shortly after the journalist\nwas placed in one of their vans, Yevloyev tried to wrestle away a gun belonging\nto one of the arresting officers. The gun went off, police said, striking\nYevloyev in the temple. Police brought Yevloyev to a Nazran hospital, where he\nwas pronounced dead.\nVladimir Markin, a spokesman with the investigative\ncommittee of Russia's prosecutor general's office, told journalists in\nSeptember 2008 that a criminal case has been opened and the case has been\ncategorized as \"murder by negligence.\" The statement left unclear whether\nregional or federal prosecutors would be in charge of the probe.\nYevloyev's Web site was well-known to human rights and press\nfreedom groups in Russia and abroad as a reliable source for information in the\ntightly controlled republic of Ingushetia in Russia's restive North Caucasus\nregion. Ingushetiya had\nreported on governmental corruption, human rights abuses, unemployment, and a\nstring of unsolved disappearances and killings in recent months. The site\ncovered antigovernment protests and had called for Zyazikov's resignation.\nOn June 6, a district court in Moscow ordered the closure of Ingushetiya for alleged extremism.\nYevloyev told CPJ at the time that he believed authorities wanted the site\nclosed because of its critical coverage. Yevloyev told CPJ that Ingushetia\nauthorities had launched more than a dozen lawsuits against the Web site in the\npast year. Despite the court's decision, Yevloyev and his colleagues continued\nto publish Ingushetiya, whose\nserver was based in the United\n  States.\nIn August, Ingushetiya Editor-in-Chief\nRoza Malsagova fled Russia after enduring harassment, threats, and beatings at the\nhands of Ingushetia authorities. Faced with a politically motivated criminal\ncase on charges of \"incitement of ethnic hatred\" and \"distribution of extremist\nmaterials,\" Malsagova sought asylum in Western Europe.\nYevloyev is survived by a wife and three young children."},{"id":1748,"location":"Russia","year":"2008","name":"Telman (Abdulla) Alishayev","organization":"Tv-chirkei","date":"September 2, 2008","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Makhachkala","job":"Columnist / Commentator","medium":"Television","coverage":"Culture","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Two unidentified assassins killed Alishayev, host of the\nprogram \"Peace to Your Home,\" which was broadcast by TV-Chirkei in Makhachkala, the regional\ncapital of the southern Russian republic\n of Dagestan.

He had been shot in the face at least four times at close range. Authorities found an audio recorder and the journalist's press credentials at the scene.\nPoveda, a 52-year-old Frenchman of Spanish descent, had documented violence in El Salvador as a filmmaker and photojournalist over the course of three decades.\nThroughout 2008, the journalist worked on a highly anticipated documentary about one of the country's most violent street gangs, Mara 18. During the filming, Poveda lived with gang members for 18 months. The documentary, \"La Vida Loca,\" was scheduled for wide release in September and had already been screened at international film festivals. It showed brutal killings, rites of initiation, and the judicial system's ineffectiveness in combating gangs. Local press reports said Poveda had received death threats from angry gang members.\nTonacatepeque was controlled by Mara 18, local press reports said. At the time of the murder, Poveda was reportedly traveling from nearby La Campanera, a town controlled by Mara 18's main rival, Mara Salvatrucha. Confrontations between the two gangs have been extremely violent. Witnesses said they called police to the scene of the killing after hearing several gunshots, according to local press reports.\nSalvadoran President Mauricio Funes issued a statement condemning Poveda's killing and calling for an end to street violence.In September 2009, local police arrested several suspects, including reputed members of Mara 18 and a police agent according to news reports. \n\nOn March 9, 2011, a special tribunal for organized crime sentenced Luis Roberto Vásquez Romero and José Alejandro Melara, two high-ranking members of Mara 18 to 30 years imprisonment on charges of masterminding and carrying out Poveda's killing, according to local and international press reports. Mara member Keyri Geraldine Mayorga Álvarez was found guilty of being an accomplice and sentenced to 20 years in prison, press reports said.\nEight other individuals, including seven gang members, were handed four-year sentences on charges of criminal association. The other, former police officer Juan Napoleón Espinoza Pérez, had labeled Poveda as a police informant, which was believed to have been a motivating factor in the murder, the San Salvador-based online newspaper ElFaro reported.\n\nTwenty other suspects tried in relation to Poveda's killing were acquitted, press reports said, although all are serving sentences in other cases, ElFaro reported. The attorney general's office said it would appeal the acquittals.\nIn August, 2013, three other members of Mara 18 were sentenced to 10 years in jail each for having participated in the planning of the murder, according to news reports.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre.

The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire.

Both are published in Avar, the language of the largest ethnic group in the volatile, multiethnic southern republic of Dagestan.\nZulfiya Gadzhiyeva, a Hakikat colleague, told CPJ that the editor sharply criticized federal and local officials for suppressing religious and political dissent under the guise of an \"anti-extremism\" campaign. In Sogratl, Akhmedilov called on regional authorities to investigate the 2008 police killing of a Sogratl resident whom law enforcement agents said was a guerrilla fighter. The journalist was also known for his investigative reporting into the recent assassinations of Dagestani officials, the Russian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\nGadzhiyeva, who visited the crime scene and met with Akhmedilov's wife and neighbors, said witnesses saw at least one killer in a parked Lada sedan with tinted windows and no license plates in the editor's neighborhood. When the journalist left in his car for an errand, the Lada followed and at least one gunman fired, she told CPJ.\nAkhmedilov's neighbors said they had seen the same Lada parked in the neighborhood for at least two days prior to the killing, Gadzhiyeva told CPJ. Akhmedilov did not report receiving any threats, she said.\nThe Dagestan Investigative Committee, the region's top investigative office, opened a probe into the murder, the agency reported on its Web site. News reports said investigators initially focused on the journalist's private life rather than his journalism.\nOn May 30, 2016, a district court in Makhachkala sentenced two local men, Murad Shuaibov and Isa Abdurakhmanov, to 10 years and six months and 8 years in jail, respectively, in connection to Akhmedilov's murder, Kavkazsky Uzel reported. According to Kavkazsky Uzel, the court found that Shuaibov shot the journalist because Akhmedilov distributed leaflets in which he said that Shuaibov was a follower of Wahhabism. The court found that Abdurakhmanov was an accomplice, for driving the getaway car. According to news reports, both men protested the accusations, declared that investigators failed to provide substantial evidence, and refused to testify. No mastermind was identified or brought to justice.\nAli Kamalov, head of the Dagestan branch of Russian Union of Journalists, told Kavkazsky Uzel that investigators know who ordered Akhmedilov's murder but are afraid of bringing them to justice.\nAccording to Kavkazsky Uzel, authorities detained both men in early 2013, and their trial began in December of that year. In March 2015 a local court convicted and sentenced them in connection to Akhmedilov's murder, but four months later, Dagestan's Supreme Court overturned the verdict on appeal based on procedural violations in the trial, reports said. The second trial, which ended with May 30 convictions, started in September 2015, Kavkazsky Uzel reported."},{"id":230,"location":"Russia","year":"2009","name":"Anastasiya Baburova","organization":"Novaya gazeta","date":"January 19, 2009","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Moscow","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Human Rights","gender":"Female","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Full Justice","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"An assailant wearing a ski mask shot Baburova, 25, a freelance correspondent for the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, at around 3 p.m. on a downtown street within walking distance of the Kremlin.

He had been arrested in February based on a criminal complaint from top presidential aide Laurent Esso.\nThe case began when Ngota and journalists with three other publications jointly sent a series of questions to Esso, secretary-general of the presidency and chairman of the state-run oil company SNH, along with a copy of a document that had been leaked to them. Their questions centered on whether 1.3 billion CFA francs (US$2.6 million) had been improperly paid to three SNH managers as \"commissions\" in the purchase of an offshore service ship, according to news reports and CPJ interviews. The accompanying document purported to be a June 2008 confidential memorandum signed by Esso that described the payments. (Esso did not publicly comment on the allegations and did not respond to CPJ's requests for a response.)\nOn February 5, intelligence agents arrested Ngota along with Harrys Robert Mintya of the weekly Le Devoir, Serge Sabouang of the bimonthly La Nation, and reporter Simon Hervé Nko'o of the weekly Bebela. Agents with the Directorate-General of External Intelligence pressed the journalists for their source of the 2008 memo, holding them each for several days, the journalists later told colleagues. By February 25, news reports said, judicial police had charged the journalists with falsifying a government document. Nko'o had gone into hiding by that time, but the others were rearrested and sent to Kondengui Prison.\nNgota died on April 22 from \"abandonment, improper care\" and the authorities' \"failure to render assistance,\" according to a prison doctor's initial death certificate, which his family shared with local journalists. A 15-year veteran of the press, Ngota was the first journalist to lose his life in the line of duty in Cameroon since CPJ began documenting media casualties in 1992.\nCPJ and other groups immediately called for an independent investigation into the death. President Paul Biya did order a judicial police inquiry \"independent of the executive\" but appeared to immediately predetermine its result. Biya asserted the case was \"not a matter of restriction of freedom of the press,\" according to news reports, and that Ngota had died of poor health. The ensuing government inquiry was riddled with irregularities.\nJust two days after Biya's announcement, Communications Minister Issa Tchoroma Bakary said Ngota had tested positive for HIV and had died from its complications--a claim disputed by Ngota's widow. Tchoroma said the findings were based on a second medical examination of Ngota's body, which he said had been held in the presence of the journalist's family--a claim denied by Ngota's brother, Bruno Ntede, according to Agence France-Presse. Félix Cyriaque Ebolé Bola, a local journalist invited by the government to be an independent witness at the examination, told CPJ that he had been given the wrong address and didn't make it to the exam.\nIn September, Justice Minister Amadou Ali presented the findings of his agency's inquiry into the death, which absolved authorities of any responsibility. The National Union of Cameroonian Journalists and Ngota's family criticized the investigation as opaque--relatives were never consulted or apprised of its progress--and inherently conflicted because the same judicial police conducting the inquiry were involved in the initial arrests of the four journalists."},{"id":1719,"location":"China","year":"2010","name":"Sun Hongjie","organization":"Northern xinjiang morning post","date":"December 28, 2010","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Kuitun","freelance":"No","description":"Reporter Sun died in a hospital in Kuitun, Xinjiang Uighur\nAutonomous Region, 10 days after being beaten by several men at a construction\nsite, news reports said.

Palacios arrived about 10 p.m. with a cousin in the back seat of a double cabin 4-by-4 pickup, and his girlfriend, a doctor, in the passenger seat. Neighbors told local reporters that a few shots were initially fired, apparently by a lookout, followed by a fusillade of gunfire as other assailants joined in. Palacios died at the scene. Dr. Yorleny Sánchez, badly injured, died two weeks later. Palacios' cousin was not injured, local press reports said.\nSeveral work-related motives emerged in a July 2010 CPJ investigation. Palacios opposed the 2009 military-backed coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya, and he had turned the TV station into an openly opposition channel, his colleagues said. Military personnel appeared at his house and detained him and his family for several hours in June 2009. That episode, along with other threats from the military, was strong enough that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued an order to the government of Honduras to protect Palacios. According to the commission, it was one of more than 400 such orders issued for journalists and activists in Honduras in 2009 and 2010. \nThe Honduran government was required by an international treaty to follow the directives, but it appeared to have ignored most of them. The government asserted that it never received an order in the Palacios case, although the Inter-American Commission noted that it had a signed receipt from the Honduran Supreme Court.\nIn the months before his slaying, Palacios campaigned on behalf of a group of several thousand peasants who had been demanding vast tracts of land they said rightfully belonged to them. They claimed that a few large landowners, in violation of agrarian reform laws, had greatly underpaid them for land many years earlier. Some of the land was retaken by the peasants--simply stolen, according to the landowners--and there were occasional armed encounters. Peasant activists said some of their leaders had been abducted and disappeared, or singled out and killed.\nAside from the wide belief that Palacios' killing was politically inspired, some CPJ sources said he could have angered a local drug gang with a recent news story about a cartel-linked kidnapping. Sources also said that Palacios, like other Tocoa journalists, had been accused of extorting money from sources. Palacios' father, José Heriberto Palacios denied his son could have been dishonest. \"They killed him because he was honest and was not corrupt,\" he told CPJ.\nThe case was marked by a series of investigative failures. Almost three months after Palacios was gunned down, a team of investigators came to his grave in his hometown of Rigores, dug up his body, and at the graveside, in the open, conducted an autopsy. The coroner never examined the body after the murder; it had gone straight from the murder scene to the funeral home. Investigators also started asking news photographers if they had any pictures of the crime scene because police had no photographs of their own. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Arody Reyes, conceded to CPJ that though the gunmen had lain in wait for hours at Palacios' house, police had not been able to retrieve any evidence from the scene.\nReyes said the exhumation and autopsy were suddenly important because the Honduran government had enlisted the help of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Local investigators, Reyes said, needed to show their U.S. counterparts something."},{"id":701,"location":"India","year":"2010","name":"Hem Chandra Pandey (Hemant Pandey)","organization":"Freelance","date":"July 2, 2010","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Andhra Pradesh","freelance":"Yes","description":"Pandey, who contributed to Hindi-language newspapers, was killed in a shootout between Maoists and state police in Andhra Pradesh, southern district of Adilabad, news reports said.

Media reports said he wrote articles under the name of Hemant Pandey in Hindi-language dailies such as Nai Dunia, Dainik Jagaran, and Rastriya Sahara. His last piece, on July 1, had been a commentary on food shortages.\nCommunist Party spokesperson Gudsa Usendi and Pandey's wife were quoted in news reports as saying the victim was meeting with Azad for an interview. They alleged the two men had been set up by police, local news reports said.\nPolice identified Pandey as a colleague of Azad. A press release by the Communist Party's north regional bureau said the reporter was a member, although party leaders also called him a journalist in local news reports. \n\nIn a press conference in Delhi following the journalist's death, his wife Babita Pandey denied Pandey was involved with Maoists, and said he had travelled to Nagpur to cover a story, according to reports. Babita Pandey said her husband wrote stories for Hindi newspapers including Nai Dunia, Rastriya Sahara, Dainik Jagran, according to investigative magazine Tehelka. Editors of all three papers denied Pandey worked for them, but Tehelka reported that it was in possession of Pandey's news clippings published under the name Hemant Pandey.\n\n \n\nPolice claimed that Pandey was Azad's colleague. A press release attributed in the press to the Communist Party's north regional bureau said the reporter was a member, although party leaders called him a journalist in local news reports.

The group added that Pandey was killed by the police in an effort to eliminate any witnesses in the killing. Police have maintained that it was an encounter killing. In India, encounter killings refer to cases where police or armed forces say they were acting in self-defense when a suspect who was unarmed or in custody dies.\n\n \n\nIn statements, the Indian Journalists' Union and the Andhra Pradesh Union of Working Journalists raised \"serious doubts about the circumstances\" of Pandey's death and demanded an independent inquiry.\n\n \n\nIn April 2011, the Supreme Court of India ordered an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the killing of Pandey and Azad. The court was hearing a petition filed by the journalist's wife, Babita Pandey, and social activist Swami Agnivesh, who claimed this was a \"fake encounter killing.\" \n\n \n\nIn a final report submitted to the Supreme Court a year later, the bureau said that the killing was a \"real\" encounter. \n\n \n\nPandey's wife was continuing legal efforts to attain justice in 2016, according to The Hindu."},{"id":1725,"location":"India","year":"2010","name":"Sushil Pathak","organization":"Dainik bhaskar","date":"December 20, 2010","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Bilaspur","freelance":"No","description":"Unidentified gunmen shot dead Sushil Pathak, a senior journalist with Dainik Bhaskar and general secretary of the Bilaspur Press Club when he was returning home from a late shift at work in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, according to reports.

Silvestre, 59, had been seized by four men outside a La Romana hotel about an hour earlier, at 8 a.m., and forced into a Jeep, according to press reports.On August 9 and 10, the attorney general's office and national police announced they had arrested five men whom they said were involved in planning or carrying out the attack. Police seized several weapons, dozens of ammunition rounds, and 118,000 pesos (US$3,070). One suspect allegedly told investigators that the assailants had planned to abduct Silvestre and take him to the capital, Santo Domingo, but shot him when the journalist resisted. All five suspects were detained, as was a sixth man who was arrested later, press reports said.Police alleged the attack was ordered by Matías Avelino Castro, also known as Joaquín Espinal Almeyda, a hotel owner and reputed drug trafficker. Authorities said they traced Avelino Castro's alleged involvement through a rental car that was used in the attack and leased through the suspect's girlfriend. The attorney general's office accused Avelino Castro of ordering the attack in retaliation for an article in the July issue of Silvestre's magazine, La Vozde la Verdad  (Voice of the Truth). The story said a man named \"Daniel,\" an alias used by the suspect, had been implicated in the recent murder of a local businessman and his driver, authorities said.Police extradited Avelino Castro from Colombia in January 2017 to face charges in the case, according to reports. On April 10, 2018, a court convicted Avelino Castro, whom police had identified as the alleged mastermind of the killing, of being an accomplice to the murder, according to reports. The court sentenced Avelino Castro to 20 years in prison, issued a fine, and ordered him to surrender two properties and a bank account.A court in July 2015 sentenced two men-- Ángel Amed Mañón Gutiérrez and Elvin Canario de Oleo-- to 30 years in prison for carrying out the murder, according to reports. Silvestre, who hosted a CañaTV program of the same name as his magazine, had accused political figures and a priest of having involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering, press reports said. In May, a local prosecutor had filed a defamation complaint against Silvestre in connection with a television report that accused the official of having ties to drug traffickers. The journalist was jailed for several days until posting bail, according to news reports. The case was pending at the time of the murder, according to Elpidio Tolentino, a local official with the press group Colegio Dominicano de Periodistas, or CDP. Silvestre had told CDP that he had been followed by two cars that tried to intercept him on July 23.In an August 9 press conference, prosecutor Frank Soto said witnesses had accused Silvestre of accepting money from drug traffickers on occasion for not publishing incriminating information or for running stories harmful to rivals, local press reports said. Tolentino said CDP challenged authorities to \"more thoroughly investigate and to present any evidence they have supporting this claim. ... If this is true they must fully investigate it. If not, they must clean his reputation.\"In November 2013, a judge freed one of the men arrested in August, Fermín Calderón, on bail. The CDP condemned the decision, saying that Calderón, who is charged with laundering money for Avelino Castro as well as for the murder of Silvestre, is a flight risk. Charges against him were later dropped due to insufficient evidence, according to reports.

The journalist died at the scene from five bullet wounds to the head and chest, his colleagues at Midday told CPJ. Dey, special investigations editor for Midday, was known for his hard-hitting coverage of Mumbai's crime world.Investigators believed reputed crime boss Chhota Rajan ordered the killing, police told reporters at a press conference. The motive for the killing was not immediately clear, police said, although colleagues told reporters they believed Dey had been targeted for his reporting.In November 2011, a journalist named Jigna Vora was arrested in connection with the murder for allegedly playing a part in the conspiracy to kill Dey, according to reports. In June 2015, a special court of the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act charged 10 suspects, including Vora and an alleged criminal known as Chhota Rajan or Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje, according to reports. Rajan was deported from Bali to India in November 2015, reports said. In January 2016, officers from the Central Bureau of Investigation questioned Rajan about the killing of Dey. Vora denied the allegation, according to reports. CPJ was unable to determine if Rajan and the other suspects also denied the charges.A 2016 supplementary charge sheet prepared by the CBI alleged that Rajan confessed to the murder to a journalist, The Hindu reported. It quoted Rajan as saying: “J. Dey was writing many articles against me in newspapers. Hence I contacted him and enquired politely whether he has any personal enmity with me. He declined but continued writing against me.. like my gang has become weak and that I am sick, my loyal people have left me etc. All such write-ups of J Dey angered me. Hence I developed an impression that he had started working for the Dawood gang. I tried to convince him before killing him. But he did not listen. I am not sure whether he was really close to Dawood gang.. but his writings made me feel like that.”Dey had covered crime in Mumbai for 22 years and had written two books, Zero Dial: The Dangerous World of Informers and Khallas."},{"id":1780,"location":"India","year":"2011","name":"Umesh Rajput","organization":"Nai dunia","date":"January 23, 2011","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Raipur district","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Corruption, Human Rights, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Local Residents","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Two masked gunmen on motorcycles shot dead Rajput, 33, a reporter with the Hindi-language daily Nai Dunia (New World), outside his home near Raipur district in Chhattisgarh state, according to local news reports.\nA note found at the scene of murder said, \"Khabar chaapna band nahi karoge toh mare jaoge\" (If you don't stop publishing news, you will die), news accounts said.\nRajput had frequently written about corruption and exploitation of tribal communities in the region, according to reports.\nRajput's family said a health worker had threatened the journalist two weeks before the shooting in relation to a story about a botched eye procedure at a local health clinic, local news reports said.

At least two assailants intercepted the journalist's car at 9:20 p.m. in Karachi's Liaquatabad area, shooting him four times in the head and once in the neck, Geo TV Managing Director Azhar Abbas told CPJ. Witnesses said one assailant spoke to Babar briefly before opening fire, Abbas said.In April, police announced the arrests of five people and said additional suspects were at large. In all, police said, at least 17 men were involved in the murder plot. Police, based on statements given by the suspects, described a plot organized by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, or MQM, Pakistan's third-largest political party and considered its most influential secular political organization. A Joint Investigation Team report said the killing had been ordered by Agha Murtaza, a South Africa-based MQM operative. Zulfikar Mirza, home minister of Sindh, was outspoken at the time in saying that MQM operatives were responsible for the killing.Local journalists believe the killing was prompted by Babar's aggressive reporting on violent political turf wars, extortion, targeted killings, electricity theft, and land-grabbing. Just weeks after Babar was slain, several people connected to the investigation were murdered. They included a police informant, two police constables, and the brother of an investigating officer. One of the constables, Asif Rafiq, was on the scene when Babar was murdered and had identified the plotters' vehicle. On November 10, 2012, two gunmen aboard a motorcycle killed Haidar Ali, the only remaining witness in the case, near his home in the Soldier Bazaar area of Karachi. He was due to testify in court two days later. The original prosecutors in the case--Muhammad Khan Buriro and Mobashir Mirza--told CPJ that they were threatened and eventually fired. They fled the country in late 2011. On March 3, 2014, more than three years after Babar was killed, a special Anti-Terrorism Court convicted six defendants for their roles in the murder. Judge Mushtaq Ahmed Leghari, who presided over the court, sentenced Naveed Polka, Muhammad Ali Rizvi, Faisal Mahmood, and Mohammad Shahrukh Khan to life in prison, news reports said. Two others, Kamran (alias \"Zeeshan\") and Faisal Mota, who remained at large, were given the death sentence in absentia. A seventh man, Mohammed Shakeel, was acquitted for lack of evidence, the reports said.In an alleged video confession posted on YouTube, Khan said he had been told to follow Babar as he was driving home from work, according to a Reuters report. He said Zeeshan had stepped in front of the journalist's car and shot him six to seven times. The video was authenticated to Reuters by the prosecutor, the report said.CPJ welcomed the convictions, the first in the murder of a Pakistani journalist, but has maintained that the masterminds are still at large.On August 16, 2017, the Sindh High Court agreed to rehear Faisal Mota's appeal against his death sentence, according to reports."},{"id":1902,"location":"Pakistan","year":"2011","name":"Zaman Ibrahim","organization":"Daily extra news","date":"April 2, 2011","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Karachi","freelance":"No","description":"Ibrahim was riding his motorcycle when two motorcyclists shot\nhim in the head, according to Pakistani news\nreports. The journalist had worked for several small Urdu-language\npapers.

Ortega, 47, had recently received death threats from an unknown source, according to The Associated Press. The journalist had openly criticized local officials accused of corruption and had opposed provincial mining projects, news reports said.\nIn a departure from most journalist murder investigations in the Philippines, police moved quickly in the case, arresting Marlon Recamata, the alleged gunman, and several suspected accomplices. Recamata pleaded guilty in February 2011 and was sentenced to life in prison in May 2013. Recamata told the court he was paid the equivalent of US$250 for the slaying, according to news reports and the victim's family.\nAn accomplice, Rodolfo Edrad, identified ex-Palawan provincial governor, Joel Reyes, and his brother, Mario Reyes, former mayor of the resort town of Coron in northern Palawan, as having ordered the murder in retaliation for Ortega's reporting on local mining operations. A Department of Justice panel had dismissed murder charges against the Reyes brothers in 2011, but a second panel reversed that decision in March 2013, based on new evidence. The following month, an appellate court blocked efforts by the Department of Justice to arrest the Reyeses, saying the department was over-reaching, according to news reports. While the department appealed, the brothers went into hiding.\nThe case has been marred in other respects. In February 2013, an accomplice who became a prosecution witness was found dead in his prison cell in Lucena City, Quezon. Prison authorities said Dennis Aranas had hanged himself, but an investigation by the public attorney's office found fingernail marks and other injuries that indicated he had likely been attacked.\nPolice in Phuket, Thailand arrested both Reyes brothers, both of whom were traveling on fake passports, for overstaying their visas. They were deported to the Philippines, where they were held in detention, according to news reports. In January 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that there was probable cause for their arrest, and returned jurisdiction for the case to Palawan's Regional Trial Court. In March 2016, Arturo \"Nonoy\" Regalado, a former aide to the governor, was found guilty by the court for his role in Ortega's assassination and sentenced to 40 years in prison.\nIn a controversial decision, the regional court granted bail to Mario Reyes in May 2016, but later in the year rejected a similar petition for Joel Reyes. Both politicians ran for elected office from prison but lost their respective bids for the vice-mayoralty and mayoralty of Coron on May 9, according to news reports. The murder trial was still in progress in late 2016."},{"id":1103,"location":"Philippines","year":"2011","name":"Maria Len Flores Somera","organization":"Dzme","date":"March 24, 2011","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Malabon City","freelance":"No","description":"An unidentified gunman shot Somera, host of a public affairs\nprogram, before fleeing the scene in a Jeep, according to The Associated Press.\nSomera, a 44-year-old mother of three, died on the way to a local hospital from\na gunshot wound to the head.\nPolice Chief Nicanor Bartolome said investigators were\nlooking into a land dispute involving Somera.

The laser pen tactic had been used by Muslim Brotherhood supporters and police during protests to identify activists for harassment or attack, according to news accounts. \nEarlier in the day, Abou Deif had shot video showing Muslim Brotherhood supporters assaulting anti-government protesters, a colleague, Hossam Sioufi, told CPJ. (A number of reporters and others later published videos showing Muslim Brotherhood supporters beating, intimidating, and detaining protesters that day.) Abou Deif was himself struck by a rubber bullet, suffering minor injuries, earlier in the day. \nAbou Deif's family and colleagues told CPJ they believed the journalist was likely targeted by the Muslim Brotherhood, and that one of his recent articles may have provided further motive. Four months earlier, Abou Deif had written a piece that said President Mohamed Morsi had included a brother-in-law in a mass July 2012 presidential pardon that encompassed 572 people. Morsi's brother-in-law, Mahmoud Aly, had been serving a three-year sentence on a bribery conviction. Morsi didn't publicly respond to About Deif's report. Soon after, Abou Deif told his brother, Salem, and several colleagues that he was being followed on the streets and was receiving threats on his Facebook page from people he identified as Muslim Brotherhood supporters, according to CPJ interviews.\nThe subsequent investigation and the government's response were marked by irregularities. In January 2013, Morsi spokesman Yassir Ali disputed any Muslim Brotherhood connection to the killing. In a letter to the Washington Post, he said \"forensic reports confirmed that Abu Deif was killed by the same type of bullet that killed seven pro-Morsi protesters at the same demonstrations.\"\nBut the government's forensic report had not been issued at that point. It was released more than a month later, in February 2013, and was notable for what it did not include. The Forensics Administration said it had not received an investigative memorandum from police, a key document that would typically include witness testimony and other details from the scene. The memorandum, which investigators are normally obligated to file in such cases, would ordinarily be used by the Forensics Administration to help determine the source and distance of the shot and other salient circumstances that would guide the prosecutor in pursuing charges. As it was, the report referred only vaguely to the distance at which the shot was fired, saying it came from \"more than a meter\" away,\" and did not specify the type of weapon or bullet used, although it described the slug as having expanded after entering Abou Deif's skull.\nStatements from witnesses such as Shahin and pressure from the Egyptian Journalists' Syndicate prompted authorities in April 2013 to summon three Muslim Brotherhood youth leaders for six hours of questioning. The accused were released for lack of evidence. The suspects were publicly identified as Ahmed Sibia, Abdel Rahman Ezz, and Ahmed al-Moghier. Sibia was also the director of Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa television office in Cairo. The three denied involvement in the killing and said their own lives had been threatened by opposition activists, according to news reports.\nThe same month, Abou Deif's family hired Fakhry Saleh, former head of the Forensics Administration, to conduct its own investigation. Saleh, using the official medical report and eyewitness testimony, concluded that a gunman fired one shot at close range using a \"dumdum\" bullet designed to expand on impact to intensify the injury.\nThe public prosecutor's office reopened the investigation in late May--only to close the case a month later with the vague explanation that it could not identify the \"original killer.\" The office referred al-Moghier for trial on charges of torturing and detaining opposition protesters during the same clashes in which Abou Deif was killed. \nAfter Morsi's ouster in July 2013, the prosecutor general's office asked a Cairo judge to examine the case independently, a step that encouraged Abou Deif's family and lawyers."},{"id":243,"location":"Honduras","year":"2012","name":"Ángel Alfredo Villatoro","organization":"Radio hrn","date":"May 15, 2012","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Tegucigalpa","freelance":"No","description":"Villatoro's body was found six days after the radio journalist was kidnapped from his car.

In the week before her murder, she covered the arrest of an allegedly high-ranking leader of the Zetas; the arrests of nine police officers charged with working for a cartel; and the story of a local mayor who was arrested with other alleged cartel gunmen after a shootout with the Mexican Army, according to news reports.\nMartínez' colleagues said she had not told them about any threats prior to her death. Two days after the murder, a state spokesperson, Gina Domínguez, said that authorities would look into Martínez' journalism as a possible motive.\nSince Martínez's death, Proceso has alleged that the most likely motive for her murder was the journalist's critical reporting on state officials. Officials have denied the claim.\nThe office of the state governor, Javier Duarte de Ochoa, ordered a special group of agents to investigate the murder. Proceso stated on its website that the state government had granted the magazine staff access to any information resulting from the investigation. The magazine also said that its executives had told the governor they were skeptical that the investigation would succeed because of the systemic dysfunction in the country.\nIn November 2012, the state attorney general announced that Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva had confessed and that robbery was the motive. But in his first court appearance, Hernández claimed he had been tortured and his family threatened if he did not make a false confession. Hernández was convicted in April 2013 and sentenced to 38 years in prison, but four months later judges voted to vacate the sentence, citing irregularities.\nIn April, Proceso reported a plot by officials in the government of Veracruz to harm Jorge Carrasco, senior editor with the magazine, who had reported extensively on Martínez's murder. A source close to the case who asked to remain anonymous told CPJ that there had been a plan under way to kill Carrasco, and that men were looking for him in Mexico City. Carrasco went into hiding with federal government protection. Proceso later published a letter from the Veracruz state attorney general's office, calling the accusations \"unfounded.\"\nWhile Governor Duarte made efforts in public statements to cast the state as a safe place for the press, under his tenure Veracruz became one of the most dangerous states for journalists in Mexico.

Cervantes was the director of the community radio station Morena FM and, until August 2013, the local correspondent for the television program \"Teleantioquia Noticias.\"\n\nThe Bogotá-based Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP) reported that Cervantes had filed at least five complaints since 2012 to the national attorney general's office about threats he said he had received. The attorney general's office granted him police protection that same year. Cervantes had said the threats began in 2010 when he reported for \"Teleantioquia Noticias\" on corruption in the local government and alleged connections between local authorities and the criminal group Los Urabeños, according to FLIP. In late 2013, he told FLIP he was abandoning news reports for musical programming as a result of ongoing threats.\n\nOn June 5, the committee that evaluates whether journalists are at risk and chooses whether to provide them with protection decided to withdraw his security detail because it determined Cervantes was no longer practicing journalism, according to FLIP.

FLIP said it had learned from the National Protection Unit of legal cases underway against Cervantes that were unrelated to his journalistic work. \nThe week after Cervantes died, the national attorney general's office announced it was creating a special unit to investigate the murder and the decision to withdraw his security detail.

The channel featured news, sports, music, and entertainment shows, according to its Facebook page.\nJuan Ramón Flores, owner of the television station CTV Canal 48 and president of the city chapter of LIBRE, told CPJ that Paz had received threats for years in connection with his political beliefs and, most recently, in relation to his on-air criticism of President Juan Orlando Hernández, who he accused of having undue influence over all branches of government. Flores said the most recent threats had been made in anonymous phone calls the week before the shooting. Paz had talked about the threats on his program, Flores said.\nTwo journalists from Comayagua, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, told CPJ that many news outlets criticized the government. One journalist said she did not believe Paz's death was related to his journalism. The other said he did not know whether the murder was related to opinions Paz had shared on the news program.\nThe day after the murder, the national attorney general's office for high impact crimes announced it would conduct a joint investigation of the murder with the local Comayagua state prosecutor's office, according to news reports.

At least 16 other people were killed and 160 wounded in the strike, according to news reports.\nAl-Aryan, a cameraman for the Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV channel, went to the market to take pictures of the bombardment when a second round of bombing hit, Samir Abu Mohsen, the channel's program director, told CPJ.\nRami Rayan, a photographer for the local news agency the Palestine Network for Press and Media, was also killed in the bombardment, Nasr Abu Foul, the network's manager, told CPJ. Rayan was at the market to cover Palestinian citizens shopping for basic necessities during a four-hour truce called by the Israeli military, Abu Foul said. Mohammed Nour al-Din al-Deiri, a Palestinian media worker for the Palestine Network for Press and Media, was killed in the attack that day, according to reports and his father, who spoke to CPJ.\nAt least two other journalists were injured in the strikes. Abu Foul told CPJ that the network's editor, Mahmoud al-Qasas, had been badly injured in the strike and was hospitalized with head injuries. The local Al-Manara media agency said its cameraman, Hamid al-Shobaky, was also injured and hospitalized.\nA graphic video posted by Al-Manara on its Facebook page shows repeated explosions rocking Shijaiyah, as the injured cry out for help amid ringing sirens. At the beginning of the video, Rayan is seen filming as ambulances arrive. By the end, he lies dead on the street among other victims. According to CNN, the video came from Al-Shobaky's camera. After he was injured, his assistant picked up the camera and continued to film.\nAn internal IDF committee led by investigators who had not been part of the chain of command during the incident found that the \"tragic\" civilian deaths on July 30 were the result of \"a number of coincidences and series of events that a military commander should not be expected to predict,\" according to a statement published in March 2015. The committee said that IDF forces fired mortar shells in response to enemy fire, not realizing that a previous round of IDF mortar fire had struck a civilian building and led to civilians, including journalists, to gather in the area despite previous orders to evacuate. The committee said that aerial surveillance was unavailable at the time but previous surveillance had not spotted civilians and that mortar shells were chosen in lieu of more powerful artillery shells to minimize collateral damage. The committee also said it could not rule out the possibility that some of the casualties that day resulted from Palestinian fire.\nThe final report of the U.N. Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict, published in June 2015, cast doubt on whether the IDF took full precautions in minimizing civilian casualties in this instance, specifically questioning why the IDF did not have real-time aerial surveillance and did not use weapons more precise than mortar rounds.

Jiménez covered crime and security for the newspapers Notisur and Liberal del Sur and had reported on local abductions and violence toward migrants, according to local journalists. The journalist sometimes used the pseudonym \"The Panther\" for security reasons, according to news reports.\nDays after finding Jiménez's body, authorities said one of the bodies found buried with him belonged to an abducted union leader whose disappearance the journalist had covered, according to news reports.\nVeracruz authorities announced they had five suspects in custody and were searching for others. One of the detainees, José Luis Márquez Hernández, who went by the name \"El Pony,\" allegedly confessed to being the leader of the group that tortured and killed the journalist, according to reports. Authorities also identified one of the detainees as Teresa de Jesús Hernández Cruz, the owner of a local bar and a neighbor of Jiménez, who they said had ordered the crime for 20,000 pesos (US$1,500) because of a personal dispute, according to news reports.\nThe Veracruz state chief of staff, Erick Lagos, initially told the daily Milenio that the murder was a matter of personal revenge and had no link to Jiménez's journalism. Local journalists told CPJ that they were disturbed by how quickly local authorities had moved to rule out any journalism-related motive in the case. State spokeswoman Gina Domínguez then backtracked and told reporters that authorities had not ruled out any motive and that they were investigating, but that they were principally looking into the theory of a personal dispute.\nSandra Segura, a journalist with the local daily Notiver, along with another journalist who asked to remain anonymous, cast doubt on the official version of the crime. Segura told CPJ that as part of his recent investigation into violence against migrants, Jiménez had written an article about the kidnapping of two migrants at a local bar. News reports conflicted as to whether the bar mentioned in the story was the same one owned by Hernández Cruz.\nCristina Hernández, the journalist's wife, told Milenio that she believed the bar owner had ordered the murder in retaliation for an article Jiménez had published about a stabbing that occurred near her bar and because of a personal dispute between their daughters. The journalist's daughters later testified that the bar owner had threatened their father because of the article about the stabbing, according to news reports.\nThe journalist's daughters said Hernández and her bar had ties to the larger activities of the feared organized crime group Los Zetas, according to reports citing family statements. Segura also questioned the plausibility of Hernández having hired so many people to participate in the crime and the relatively small amount of money allegedly involved.\nOn February 13, several of the detainees, who were denied bail, said in a hearing that they had previously confessed to the crime under torture by law enforcement officials, according to news reports.\nTwo days later, the state Attorney General Felipe Amadeo Flores Espinosa said that several international and local human rights and journalist groups, including CPJ, would be granted access to the files in the investigation, which he emphasized was ongoing and would include the journalist's work as a possible motive.\nOn the weekend of February 15, a group of journalists and representatives from local and international free press organizations, calling itself the \"Observation Mission,\" traveled to Veracruz, spoke with local authorities, and requested that the federal special prosecutor for crimes against freedom of expression take jurisdiction for the case.\nDays after the mission, in the face of sustained criticism, both Flores and Domínguez resigned from their positions, although officials denied it was related to Jiménez's murder. CPJ was told by the incoming Attorney General's office that it would still have access to the files on the murder.\nVeracruz is one of the most dangerous states in Mexico for the press, according to CPJ research. Since 2011, at least two journalists have been killed in Veracruz in relation to their work, according to CPJ research. CPJ is investigating the deaths of at least six others in unclear circumstances. At least three journalists have disappeared in the state in the same time period. In 2013, CPJ documented serious irregularities in the case against a man convicted in the 2012 murder of Proceso magazine's Veracruz correspondent, Regina Martínez Pérez."},{"id":878,"location":"Mexico","year":"2014","name":"Jorge Torres Palacios","organization":"Dictamen, Libertad guerrero noticias","date":"May 29, 30, 31, June 1, or 2, 2014","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Acapulco","freelance":"No","description":"The decapitated body of columnist and government spokesman Jorge Torres Palacios was found in a bag in an orchard in Guerrero state on June 2, four days after he was abducted by unidentified assailants at his home in Acapulco, according to news reports.\nTorres wrote a weekly column on politics and security, called \"Nothing Personal,\" for the Acapulco newspaper El Dictamen.

Prior to that, he hosted news programs on the Guerrero state radio and TV networks.\nNo ransom was demanded after his abduction, according to colleagues.\nSome local journalists who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal told CPJ they did not think Torres' murder was in relation to his work. But other local journalists criticized official statements and press releases in which, they said, authorities referred only to Torres' government position and did not acknowledge his work as a journalist, according to the daily La Jornada Guerrero. Torres had written several columns critical of local officials shortly before his death.\nIn what El Dictamen said was his last column, published shortly after he was abducted, Torres criticized the mayor of Chilpancingo, capital of Guerrero state, accusing him of putting personal political ambition ahead of problems such as crime and corruption. Some of his columns include one published in March in Libertad Guerrero Noticias, in which he accused a state senator of putting gubernatorial plans ahead of congressional work. Another column the same month in Libertad Guerrero Noticias criticized the son of current Guerrero Gov. Ángel Aguirre, who the journalist alleged wanted to run for mayor of Acapulco.\nOn June 7, the case was officially handed over to the organized crime division of the federal Attorney General's office, or SEIDO, because officials said state investigators had received threats from organized crime figures that warned them not to dig too deep into the case, according to news reports. The Guerrero state attorney general told reporters that authorities were investigating a possible link to organized crime, but did not provide further details.\nJournalists from across Guerrero held public protests demonstrating against Torres' abduction and murder."},{"id":1382,"location":"Mexico","year":"2014","name":"Octavio Rojas Hernández","organization":"El buen tono","date":"August 11, 2014","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Oaxaca","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Corruption, Crime","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group, Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Rojas was lured from his home at around 5:30 p.m. by an individual who said he wanted to purchase a vehicle from the journalist, according to the Oaxaca attorney general's office who issued a statement.

Canindeyú has also been the site of violent land disputes, according to news reports.\n\"Pablo Medina was the object of many threats mainly due to his journalistic investigations of marijuana production,\" Vargas told reporters.\nVargas said police had been providing Medina with bodyguards, but the journalist was unescorted at the time of the attack.

The reports said authorities feared that Acosta had fled to Brazil because the country does not have an extradition treaty with Paraguay. Authorities requested an international warrant for the arrest of all four men from Interpol, according to news reports.\nABC Color alleged that Acosta's political and police connections, including a prominent congresswoman, had allowed the men to flee.

His reports included coverage of Islamist militant groups who he said had imposed taxes on Christians and who he said had prevented aid from being delivered to the city.\nAs part of his work for Shaam News Network, Ibrahim also appeared on the opposition-based TV channels Syria al-Hur and Syria al-Ghad. He also worked for an online campaign called \"Raqqa is being slaughtered silently,\" which posts news and photos of events in Raqqa and has criticized the harsh rule imposed by the Islamic State.\nAbu Ibrahim Ar-Raqqawi, a Raqqa citizen who runs the campaign, told the Wall Street Journal that Ibrahim was killed because Islamic State militants caught him with material belonging to the campaign.\nAr-Raqqawi told CPJ that he and Ibrahim would meet in secret repeatedly to share news and information for the campaign because Islamic State had placed media restrictions on journalists covering Raqqa.\nIslamic State has imposed restrictions on independent voices and journalists, according to CPJ research. Since the group came to power, it has kidnapped many journalists and raided numerous media centers. Islamic State has also ordered journalists and media workers to pledge allegiance to the group, according to the Syrian Journalists Association. As a result, journalists have fled territories controlled by the group, submitted to self-censorship, or continued their work anonymously at great risk."},{"id":191,"location":"Syria","year":"2014","name":"Ali Mustafa","organization":"Freelance","date":"March 9, 2014","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Aleppo","job":"Photographer","medium":"Print, Internet","coverage":"Human Rights, Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Mustafa, a Canadian freelance photographer, was killed along with seven other individuals in consecutive bomb blasts in Aleppo.

U.S. officials said the captors were alerted to the approaching special forces team, perhaps by a barking dog, and shot the hostages, according to news reports. Medics were unable to save either hostage. \nU.S. officials said the captors were likely on high alert after a failed attempt to rescue Somers in another special forces raid the previous month in Hadramawt. In a press release on December 4, 2014, National Security Council Spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said Obama had authorized the first rescue operation in coordination with Yemeni security forces to save Somers and other hostages after receiving reliable intelligence of their location but that Somers was not present when the forces arrived.\nAccording to news reports citing Yemeni officials, eight captives were freed in the first rescue operation after a gun battle with the militants but several other hostages, including Somers, were not rescued. The reports said the U.S. government had originally asked the media not to report on U.S. involvement in the raid for fear it would increase the danger to Somers.\nThe original raid led AQAP to acknowledge publicly for the first time that it was holding Somers, which the group did in a video released late at night on December 3, 2014. In the video, which was reviewed by CPJ before being removed from YouTube, Somers said he was kidnapped in Sana'a more than a year earlier and that his life was in danger. His statement was preceded by Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, one of the leaders of AQAP, saying that Somers \"will meet his inevitable fate\" unless the U.S. met the group's unspecified demands.\nSenior U.S. and Yemeni officials told ABC that they did not know what those demands were but speculated they may involve a prisoner exchange. U.S. officials cited the three-day deadline as the primary impetus for launching the second raid, according to news reports. \nIn a video released on December 4, 2014, Somers' brother, Jordan, and mother, Paula, appealed for Somers' release and said they did not know why Somers was being held. \"Luke is only a photojournalist, and he is not responsible for any actions the U.S. government has taken,\" his brother said in the video.\nSomers was kidnapped on a busy street in the middle of Sana'a in September 2013, according to news reports. No group claimed responsibility, but Somers' colleagues told CPJ at the time that they feared he was taken by Al-Qaeda or would be sold to them.\nSomers, who was born in the U.K. and was an American citizen, moved to Yemen in 2010, where he soon began working as a freelance journalist, according to news reports. His coverage of the 2011 revolution in Yemen and its aftermath was published by international and local outlets including Al-Jazeera English, BBC, Foreign Policy, Inter Press Service, National Yemen, The New York Times, and Yemen Times.

According to news reports, Aliyev also contributed reporting to several independent news outlets including the independent Azerbaijan News Network.\n \nAccording to an interview Aliyev gave Meydan TV in hospital before he died, posted on the YouTube page of the independent broadcaster, the 30-year-old journalist said he believed he was attacked over a post on his personal Facebook page in which he criticized Javid Huseynov, a soccer player with Azerbaijani club Gabala FC. According to the video and news reports, Aliyev said he received a phone call from an individual who claimed to be related to Huseynov. Aliyev said the caller argued with him over the phone about the Facebook post, then asked to meet. After the pair shook hands, Aliyev said he received a heavy blow to his left ear, and was attacked from behind.\n \nAccording to news reports and Aliyev's account to Meydan TV, he said at least six people beat and kicked him in the Sabail district of Baku, before stealing his wallet and cell phone.\n \nAliyev was taken to a hospital to be treated for broken ribs and difficulty in hearing after the attack, according to the U.S.-government funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. According to a RFE/RL Azeri service report that cited Aliyev's friends who visited him in the hospital, injuries including a ruptured spleen and internal bleeding were not identified by doctors until the journalist started to complain of chest pain. \n \nAliyev took over as chairman of the Institute for Reporters' Freedom and Safety when its previous chairman, Emin Huseynov, was forced to flee into exile in August 2015, the press freedom group said.

He published the post on July 2, the day Azerbaijan celebrates its police.\n \nAmid a crackdown on traditional media in Azerbaijan, some activists and journalists have taken to social networking sites to give the public an alternative to state media, CPJ has found.\n \nExiled Azerbaijani reporters and international reporters with whom CPJ spoke claimed Azerbaijani authorities were responsible for Aliyev's death because they failed to investigate threats and created conditions in which journalists can be attacked with impunity. One local journalist, who spoke to CPJ on condition of anonymity, said Aliyev's beating took place a year after authorities raided the offices of Institute for Reporters' Freedom and Safety.\n \nAzerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who is not related to the journalist, condemned the attack and called it a \"threat to freedom of speech and expression,\" according to regional press reports. Authorities have charged at least six people over the attack, including Huseynov, reports said. Their detention was extended in November 2015 and trial was pending at year's end, reports said.\n \nAccording to independent regional news website Kavkazsky Uzel, authorities classified the investigation as an attack with intent to inflict grave bodily harm that resulted in an unexpected death. The website said the journalist's family contested this in September 2015 and said it should be classified as intent to murder.

He said \"I don't remember\" when CPJ asked for details of the murder in which the journalist was accused of being involved.\nIn September 2016, The Times of India reported that Uttar Pradesh state police had dropped the charges against Singh that they had said were the reason for his arrest. According to the report, police in May 2015 registered a case of attempted murder and kidnapping against Singh after a complaint by Amit Bhadauria, also a journalist.\nSingh wrote on local politics and current affairs in Hindi-language newspapers and on his two Facebook pages, which have more than 4,000 followers combined. English- and Hindi-language news reports did not specify what newspapers he had written for. His son said Singh posted news stories on Facebook based on information he obtained through India's Right to Information law and other sources, according to The Indian Express.\nSingh often wrote critically about Verma, alleging that he was involved in illegal mining and land grabs, the reports said. In a May 31 Hindi-language Facebook post with an accompanying photo of Verma, the journalist alleged that the minister was involved in the gang rape of a local woman, claims that were also reported in Hindi-language media. In another post a day earlier, Singh questioned the land holdings amassed by the minister.\nIn a Facebook post on May 22, Singh wrote: \"Ram Murti Singh Verma can have me killed. At this time, politician, thugs, and police, all are after me. Writing the truth is bearing heavily on my life. After exposing some of Ram Murti Verma's acts, he had me attacked...\"\nCPJ was not able to reach Verma for response to the allegations against him.\nNo arrests were made immediately after Singh's death. In the days following Singh's death, local journalists and members of other political parties called on the chief minister of the state, Akhilesh Yadav, to remove Verma from his cabinet, according to news reports.

Ahmad al-Rubaei, from the Iraqi monitoring group Journalistic Freedoms Observatory, told CPJ al-Hadidi was killed on July 15, 2014. However, the Nineveh Media Foundation, a small Iraqi monitoring group, said that al-Hadidi's family were not summoned to identify his body until March 2015.

The journalist and owner of the newspaper La Unión had been missing since January 2. On February 5, federal investigators said their DNA tests had confirmed the body was that of Sánchez, according to news reports.\nSánchez was kidnapped from his home in the municipality of Medellín de Bravo on January 2 and his computer, camera, and other electronic materials seized, according to news reports. The journalist had founded La Unión, a small weekly print and online newspaper that often criticized city authorities, particularly the mayor, Omar Cruz Reyes, and denounced local criminal activity as well as the poor quality of basic services like garbage pickup and the absence of street lights.\nA local journalist who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal told CPJ that Sánchez had not published a print edition in months due to financial constraints. The last story published on La Unión's website dated to April 2014, according to CPJ research. In the months before his death, according to local journalists and news reports, Sánchez had posted on Facebook critical commentary about crime and the actions of the local government, links to articles, and videos. He also acted as a source for other Veracruz journalists, whom he often provided with photographs and other information.\nIn the days before Sánchez was kidnapped, the journalist posted on Facebook several photographs of protests against the governor, Javier Duarte de Ochoa, as well as links to articles about a recent murder. On December 13 and 14, he posted several articles, press releases, and a video regarding the formation of a neighborhood watch self-defense group in response to local crime. It wasn't clear whether Sánchez, who was also active in the group, was the author of any of the materials posted on Facebook.\nThe journalist who asked to remain anonymous told CPJ that information about self-defense groups was particularly sensitive for local officials who sought to downplay shortcomings in local law enforcement. The journalist's son, Jorge Sánchez, told CPJ that his father had been threatened by the mayor in connection with his coverage of the groups.\nThe state attorney general told reporters after the crime that he had evidence pointing toward the mayor. \"I have elements to suggest the mayor's participation,\" Veracruz state attorney general Luis Ángel Bravo said.\nThe state attorney general's office said a former Veracruz police officer turned drug trafficker, Noé Rodríguez, confessed to carrying out the abduction and murder, along with five other suspects, and said he had killed Sánchez the day of the kidnapping. The suspects were allegedly told by the deputy police chief of Medellín, Martín López Meneses, to kidnap and kill Sánchez, according to the state attorney general's office's statement which cited Rodríguez. López, who was also the driver and bodyguard of Mayor Cruz, was placed under preventive detention shortly after the murder.\nRodríguez also alleged that López had received his orders from Mayor Cruz, who wanted the journalist to be \"disappeared\" because he was angered by Sánchez' coverage of local crime, according to news reports. In exchange, the reports said, Cruz would allow the criminal gang to deal drugs in the area. Cruz has denied involvement in the crime and maintained that he had no disagreements with Sánchez, according to news reports.\nIn March 2015, the Veracruz state legislature voted to strip Cruz of the immunity from prosecution granted to him as an elected official.

One of the victims, Nadia Vera, was a friend of Espinosa's and a student activist in Xalapa, the Veracruz online publication Plumas Libres reported.\nEspinosa fled Veracruz state and arrived in Mexico City in June 2015, he told CPJ in an interview that month. He worked for the local news agency AVC Noticias, the national newsweekly Proceso, and photo agency Cuartoscuro and often covered local activist causes, local journalists told CPJ.\nEspinosa had been threatened repeatedly in the past few years. He told CPJ in June that he fled Veracruz after he noticed people outside his home in Xalapa three separate times who gave him intimidating glances and gestures. He said that in 2013, he was among the journalists attacked by police during a September 2013 eviction of protesting teachers and students. In 2012, he said, an unidentified man \"grabbed me by the shirt, threw me up against a metal curtain and told me, 'Stop taking photos ... if you don't want to end up like Regina Martínez.'\"\nRegina Martínez Pérez, the Veracruz correspondent for Proceso, was killed in April 2012 after critical reporting on state officials.\nEspinosa had clashed in previous years with authorities in Veracruz.

Javier Duarte de Ochoa that was published in Proceso on February 15, 2014, under the headline \"Veracruz: Lawless State.\"\nBefore fleeing to Mexico City, Espinosa was very active within a group of Veracruz journalists who called on state authorities to investigate crimes against murdered journalists, a Mexican journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity told CPJ. \"He became one of the leaders of the group and represented them in meeting with authorities,\" the journalist said.\nOn August 4, authorities in Mexico City arrested Daniel Pacheco Gutiérrez, who they said was a suspect in connection with the killing, prosecutor Rodolfo Rios Garza announced. Investigators said his fingerprints had been found at the crime scene and matched to a database which showed he had a criminal record for rape and assault, the BBC reported.\nAccording to press reports, Pacheco said he had been in the apartment but that he hadn't participated in the murders. In a statement he gave to prosecutors, he said he had been invited by an individual named José Abraham to meet a Colombian woman he knew in that neighborhood. On August 11, the national daily Reforma reported that Pacheco had identified two accomplices: Abraham, who Pacheco said was a former Mexico City police officer and guarded parked cars in the streets in exchange for money, and an individual known as Omar, who he said was a juggler who performed at traffic intersections.\nPacheco was accused of murder, femicide, and aggravated robbery. The other two men were fugitives.\nWhen interrogated by a Mexican judge, Pacheco alleged he had been tortured and beaten, the local press reported. A photograph of Pacheco in custody, which was released to the press, showed the left side of his face swollen, according to press reports.\nInvestigators said they had not disregarded any motive in the multiple homicide, including Espinosa's work. But local journalists and activists said that authorities were not looking into the photographer's work or the threats he had received. They also pointed out inconsistencies in the investigation: Investigators said the murders took place sometime between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., but Espinosa's final text messages, obtained by The Associated Press, show that he was still alive at 2:13 p.m.\nVeracruz is one of the most dangerous states for the press in Mexico, according to CPJ research.

Mohamed Saleh, a member of the pro-opposition Hama Media Center, confirmed Abu al-Hamza was filming for SMART, adding that he also worked for the media center.\n\nSaleh said he was accompanying Abu al-Hamza, Mustafa Abu Arab, who is also part of the Hama Media Center, and Ali Abu Farouk, a correspondent for the local pro-opposition Step News Agency, on the day Abu al-Hamza was killed. Pictures posted by the journalists show the four of them riding motorcycles and carrying their cameras on their way to Tel Sukayk. Abu al-Hamza appears in the pictures in jeans, black shirt, and brown jacket, camera in hand.\n\nOnce reaching the hilltop, Abu Farouk began interviewing an opposition fighter for Step News Agency. Saleh told CPJ the fighter was a member of Ajnad al-Sham, a group fighting as part of the broad Islamist coalition, Jaish al-Fateh.\n\nIn a graphic video posted by Abu Arab to his YouTube page the following day, the same Ajnad al-Sham fighter is seen speaking to Abu al-Hamza about the offense as the faint sound of a mortar firing can be heard in the distance. As the fighter looks up, a mortar shell hits in front of the camera. The camera was propelled to the ground by the blast but continued to record the sound of those who had been injured.\n\nThe journalist's colleagues told CPJ Abu al-Hamza and the Ajnad al-Sham fighter were killed. Saleh, Abu Arab, and Abu Farouk were injured in the explosion and an Ajnad al-Sham fighter needed his hand amputated, Saleh said.\n\nThe SMART News correspondent Hoeesh told CPJ that Abu al-Hamza joined the agency two months earlier and was still in his probationary period when he died.\n\nDuring his probationary period with SMART, Abu al-Hamza posted numerous SMART videos to his Facebook page, which he claimed to have filmed in the Hama countryside and which showed opposition forces fighting or government aircraft bombing. SMART News Agency typically does not add bylines to its videos. In the week before his death, the agency published several photos under his byline of opposition forces shelling government positions and ruins in the wake of government bombing.\n\nBoth Saleh and Hoeesh told CPJ Abu al-Hamza also worked for the media office of a local branch of Ahrar al-Sham, another rebel group belonging to the Jaish al-Fateh coalition. Several of Ahrar al-Sham's founders had ties to al-Qaeda and, at the time of Abu al-Hamza's death, the Jaish al-Fateh coalition included al-Qaeda's official branch in Syria, the Nusra Front.\n\nSaleh, who also was a member of the Ahrar al-Sham's local media office until he quit after Abu al-Hamza's death, said that Abu al-Hamza joined the group as a fighter but became involved only in media work nearly two years ago. Saleh explained how a crew from the media office would join fighters on the battlefield, each of them focusing on filming different kinds of weaponry to get the full picture of the battle.\n\nAbu al-Hamza's Facebook shows his apparent support for Ahrar al-Sham, with his banner picture featuring the group's logo and frequent posts about the group's fighters and leaders who had been killed. In what appear to be posts related to his role as part of the group's media office, he shared pictures and messages of support for fighters. In May 2015, he posted a picture of what he said were two Ahrar al-Sham fighters detaining a \"supporter of the Assad gangs.\" A few days later, he posted a picture purportedly distributed by Islamic State of the heads of beheaded opposition fighters in a truck bed. Two weeks later, in an apparent response, he posted pictures of rebels, including one he said was a member of Ahrar al-Sham, holding the heads of beheaded Islamic State fighters."},{"id":120,"location":"Syria","year":"2015","name":"Ahmed Mohamed al-Mousa","organization":"Raqqa is being slaughtered silently","date":"December 16, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Idlib","job":"Editor","medium":"Internet","coverage":"Human Rights, Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Al-Mousa, a 23-year-old editor for Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS) was shot dead in Idlib province, according to news reports and RBSS, the Syrian citizen journalist group CPJ honored with its 2015 International Press Freedom Award.\nAbdel Aziz al-Hamza, a spokesperson for RBSS, told CPJ that al-Mousa was shot twice in the head in front of the family home in Abu al-Duhur, a town in Idlib, by a masked attacker on a motorcycle. In a picture CPJ has viewed of al-Mousa's body, which his family sent to al-Hamza, bandages can be seen around the journalist's head and neck.\nAl-Mousa's murder came amid a campaign of violence by the Islamic State militant group against members of RBSS and other Syrian journalists. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the murders of at least two RBSS members. In October 2015, Ibrahim Abd al-Qader was killed alongside fellow journalist Fares Hamadi in Urfa, southeastern Turkey. In May 2014, Al-Moutaz Bellah Ibrahim was kidnapped and murdered by the militants.\nSome supporters of Islamic State claimed on Twitter after al-Mousa's murder that their \"soldiers\" killed him, and referred to him as an \"apostate\" and \"agent of crusaders.\" In a video published online on March 8, 2016 by Islamic State's local branch in Deir Ezzor, Syria, the militant group claimed responsibility for the murders of all four journalists. The video, \"Escaping won't do you any good,\" shows two new hostages who identify themselves as Mohamed al-Kardoush and Jamal al-Ati, whom the militants accuse of providing information to Western governments. It was not immediately clear if the hostages are journalists.\nAl-Mousa was also named in a video released by Islamic State on January 3, 2016 showing the murder of five men. In the 10-minute video the men say they covertly filmed Islamic State activity and opened an Internet café to share material with news outlets and Turkey-based activists, including al-Mousa. Al-Hamza denied any of the hostages worked with RBSS. Western intelligence agencies are investigating the authenticity of the video, according to news reports.\nThe Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate that controls Idlib, told al-Hamza it is investigating al-Mousa's death.\nAccording to al-Hamza, al-Mousa edited and vetted reports for RBSS from Raqqa out of Gaziantep in Turkey and Idlib in Syria. He went into hiding in Idlib several months before his death, after Islamic State kidnapped his father and released a video of his murder in August 2015. One week after al-Mousa's murder, Islamic State claimed to have killed the journalist's aunt, Maria Hasan al-Shams, al-Hamza said. She was taken captive in October after militants found a picture on her phone of Hamoud al-Mousa, who is the brother of the dead journalist and one of RBSS's co-founders, al-Hamza told CPJ.\nSince April 2014, RBSS has documented the abuses of Islamic State in Raqqa.

Like all journalists working in Syria for Ajras al-Awdah, Khalifeh mostly wrote without a byline or photo credit. In January 2014, Khalifeh wrote an article, with his byline, that criticized the Syrian government for failing to deliver humanitarian aid to the camp besieged by its forces.\nKhalifeh also helped produce a film about daily life in the camp, which was published on YouTube by the not-for-profit Syrian media company Bidayyat two days after his death.\nFakhredeen told CPJ that he and Khalifeh had spoken in the week before his death. The editor said that although Khalifeh had not been specifically commissioned that day, the organization would have been published the footage of Islamic State's assault on Yarmouk.\nAccording to Abdullah al-Khatib, a media activist who was also the journalist's friend, colleague, and roommate, Khalifeh had gone to cover the heavy shelling that day. Khalifeh lived with five other media activists, Khatib said.\nIn the following days, Khatib and others wrote about Khalifeh on Facebook. The journalist was a risk taker, one of his roommates told CPJ via Skype: \"He was young, he went places others didn't. He wanted to tell Yarmouk's stories. He was a great friend and he will be missed.\""},{"id":866,"location":"Syria","year":"2015","name":"Jomaa Al-Ahmad (Abu al-Nour al-Halabi)","organization":"Shahba press agency","date":"October 27, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Aleppo","job":"Broadcast Reporter, Camera Operator, Internet Reporter","medium":"Internet","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","description":"Jomaa al-Ahmad, a correspondent for Shahba Press Agency, was killed by an airstrike on Hayan, in Aleppo province, on October 27, 2015, while filming an airstrike for the privately owned outlet, Mamoun al-Khatib, the director of Shahba Press Agency, told CPJ.\nAl-Ahmad died from injuries when the area he was filming in was struck four times by bombs dropped from warplanes, the Violations Documentation Center in Syria, a monitoring group, said. The report by the group, which Al-Ahmad had also worked with, said he was seriously injured in the fourth blast.\nThree minutes of footage of three airstrikes taken by al-Ahmad and recovered by a colleague after his death, was posted on his press agency's YouTube channel. From minute 0.40 to 1.12, the footage shows a family escaping from a building surrounded by dust and rubble. Al-Ahmad tells the camera the mosque has been hit. At 1.35, as he interviews a man who says civilians have been targeted in the attacks, a third airstrike hits close by. Several minutes later a fourth bomb strikes and badly wounds al-Ahmad, al-Khatib said. The footage posted on YouTube does not show this explosion.\nAl-Khatib told CPJ that al-Ahmad was rushed to the Turkish border for treatment, but had died by the time the director arrived about an hour later. Activists told the media that two Syrian civil defense members and a number of civilians were injured in the attacks on Hayan that day.\nThe Shahba Press Agency and Violations Documentation Center in Syria both accused Russia of carrying out the airstrikes on Hayan. The violations center cited a Hayan-based media activist as saying the fourth airstrike on October 27, allegedly launched by Russia, struck a house in the town. Al-Ahmad, who was standing about 10 meters from the house at the time, was injured, the center said.\nThe Russian military began airstrikes on Syria in September 2015, ostensibly targeting Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other militant groups. Russia has come under criticism from the Syrian opposition and their supporters for allegedly using the strikes to target all rebels fighting the government of Bashar al-Assad, a long-time strategic ally of Russia. Human rights and civil society groups have criticized the strikes for indiscriminately targeting civilians.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry has not not responded to CPJ's emailed request for comment. The ministry published a report on October 28, 2015 saying that Russian planes made 71 combat sorties, engaging 118 \"terrorist objects,\" in the previous 24 hours including in Aleppo. Hayan was not specifically mentioned.\nSyrian state news agency SANA said government warplanes also hit Hayan on October 27, targeting \"terrorist organizations.\" The report said the \"terrorists\" the airstrikes targeted named al-Ahmad as being among those killed. CPJ is unable to confirm whether Russian or Syrian airstrikes targeted Hayan on the day al-Ahmad died.\nOn its website, Shahba Press Agency commemorated al-Ahmad's commitment to documenting the war. Al-Ahmad is survived by his wife and four children, the article said. Shahba Press Agency was established in 2013 in Aleppo and describes itself as a neutral news agency, run by Syrian journalists and not affiliated with any government or political party. Al-Ahmad had headed the Hayan office of Shahba Press Agency since 2013, al-Khatib said.\nA week before the Hayan airstrikes, an attack allegedly carried out by a Russian warplane struck Binin, a town in Idlib province, killing Syrian journalist Wasem Aledel."},{"id":954,"location":"Syria","year":"2015","name":"Kenji Goto","organization":"Freelance","date":"January 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Unknown","job":"Camera Operator, Photographer, Internet Reporter","medium":"Television, Internet","coverage":"Culture, Human Rights, Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"Yes","threatened":"No","description":"On January 31, 2015, the militant group Islamic State released a video purporting to show the beheading of Japanese journalist Kenji Goto, according to news reports. Japanese authorities said the footage appeared to be authentic, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed to \"make the terrorists pay,\" according to reports.\nA member of the militant group, who according to some news reports is the same man who murdered American freelancers James Foley and Steven Sotloff in 2014, claimed in the video that Goto, also known as Kenji Jogo, was killed in retribution for Japan's participation in a coalition set up to stop Islamic State, according to news reports. Japan was not involved in airstrikes carried out in Iraq and Syria since August, but it had offered humanitarian aid to countries fighting Islamic State.\n\nIslamic State had previously released four messages about Goto. In a video released on January 20, the group threatened to kill Goto and another Japanese hostage, Haruna Yukawa, unless it received a US$200 million ransom--the same sum the Japanese government had pledged in humanitarian assistance, according to news reports. On January 24, the group released a video, with an audio message purportedly narrated by Goto, saying that Yukawa had been killed and changing the ransom demand to the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, a would-be Iraqi suicide bomber imprisoned in Jordan. On January 27, Islamic State released a third message, again purportedly narrated by Goto, warning that if al-Rishawi was not released within 24 hours, Goto and Muath al-Kaseasbeh, a Jordanian pilot also held captive by the group, would be killed. The following day the group distributed a final warning that if al-Rishawi was not brought to the Syrian-Turkish border by sunset on January 29, al-Kaseasbeh, would be killed immediately.\n\nIn response to the threats, Jordanian officials said they would be willing to release al-Rishawi in exchange for al-Kaseasbeh and Goto, according to news reports. In a video released on February 3, Islamic State militants killed al-Kaseasbeh by locking him in a cage and setting him alight. After the video's release Jordanian officials said, without citing evidence, that al-Kaseasbeh had been killed on January 3, weeks before the public negotiations began, according to news reports. If true, the claim brings into doubt whether a deal to release Goto and al-Kaseasbeh had been on the table. None of the publicly released messages from Islamic State explicitly offered the pilot's release.\n\nIn 1996, Goto founded Independent Press, a news website covering conflict, refugee populations, and poverty. Major Japanese outlets, including NHK World and Tokyo Broadcasting System, featured its reports. The 47-year-old journalist had covered the Syrian conflict with a focus on its humanitarian impact since the start of the civil war.\n\nHe disappeared in Syria on October 25 and on December 2 his wife, Rinko, received a message from Goto's captors confirming his kidnapping, his wife explained in a statement given to the freelancer support charity Rory Peck Trust on January 29. Rinko said in the statement that Goto \"went to Syria to show the plight of those who suffer,\" adding that she believes he \"may have also been trying to find out about Haruna Yukawa's situation.\"\n\n\nIn a video filmed in Aleppo and posted on YouTube on October 25, Goto said he planned to travel to Raqqa, the Islamic State stronghold, to \"get the story of what ISIS [Islamic State] wants to do in Syria.\" He said he understood he was entering dangerous territory and that he would take responsibility if anything happened to him. According to Japanese media reports, Goto had told friends he would be back in Japan on October 29 to speak at an event.\n\nSeveral news reports, including one that cited Goto's fixer in Syria who filmed the Aleppo video, said Goto went to Raqqa in search of Yukawa, who was abducted in August. According to Reuters, Yukawa and Goto first met in Syria in April 2014 and traveled to Iraq together in June. In August, Goto told Reuters that Yukawa needed someone with experience to help him survive combat zones.\n\nAt the request of the family, the Committee to Protect Journalists did not publicize Goto's case until the release of the January 20 video.\n\nAs with Foley and Sotloff, it is not clear where and when Islamic State murdered Goto."},{"id":1224,"location":"Syria","year":"2015","name":"Mohammed al-Asfar","organization":"Al-jazeera","date":"June 26, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Daraa","job":"Camera Operator","medium":"Television","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","description":"Al-Jazeera cameraman Mohamed al-Asfar was killed while covering clashes between regime forces and rebels in the southern Syrian province of Daraa, the pan-Arab broadcaster reported.

SMART's general coordinator, Abdou al-Fadhel, told CPJ Ghazal died while covering the bombardment for the outlet.\n\nGhazal's brother, Ghaith, told CPJ that Ghazal was at his family's house when they heard the sound of barrel bombs exploding. Ghazal was killed after leaving the house to film the bombardment and to help the injured. Ghaith told CPJ his brother intended to send footage of the bombing to SMART but was killed before he could capture any footage.\n\nSMART reported that Ghazal died from shrapnel wounds to the chest and shoulder. Some pro-opposition outlets published a graphic picture of Ghazal after he had died, with a deep gash in his right shoulder.\n\nThree days before Ghazal's death Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, described barrel bombs as \"Assad's most devastating weapon\" used against civilians. Since the start of the civil war, the Assad government has arbitrarily bombed civilian areas such as Taftanaz by rolling makeshift bombs filled with shrapnel and explosives out the doors of its fleet of helicopters. President Bashar al-Assad has denied indiscriminately bombing civilians with barrel bombs despite the overwhelming evidence presented by human rights groups and international observers. \n\nLocal news reports said at least five people were killed and more than two dozen were injured in the bombing of Taftanaz, and the pro-opposition Taftanaz Media Office published graphic footage of the wounded receiving treatment at a crowded clinic.\n\nThe day before Ghazal's death, government and opposition forces agreed to a wide-ranging ceasefire in Idlib province, including Taftanaz, in the wake of major rebel advances, news reports said. The most powerful rebel coalition fighting in Idlib, Jaish al-Fateh, responded to the bombardment of Taftanaz by shelling government-held towns nearby, according to reports. Despite the violent start, the ceasefire largely held in the weeks after Ghazal's death, reports said.\n\nSMART News Agency said Ghazal previously worked as a reporter for the Taftanaz Media Office and the media office for Ahrar al-Sham, a rebel groups belonging to the Jaish al-Fateh coalition. Several of Ahrar al-Sham's founders had ties to al-Qaeda and, at the time of Ghazal's death, the Jaish al-Fateh coalition included al-Qaeda's official branch in Syria, the Nusra Front. SMART's coordinator al-Fadhel said Ghazal joined the news agency in 2013 and was not working for any other organization besides SMART.\n\nGhaith Ghazal confirmed his brother had been part of Ahrar al-Sham as a fighter and a member of one of its media centers, helping to publicize the group, but that he was no longer a member of Ahrar al-Sham when he began working for SMART.\n\nGhazal regularly posted videos published by SMART on Facebook but because SMART does not usually use bylines for its videos, it was not clear which were filmed by him. Three weeks before his death, SMART published photos under Ghazal's byline of rubble left behind in Sarmin by what the agency said was government shelling in the Idlib province town.\n\nGhaith Ghazal told CPJ that his 24-year-old brother was married and has a two-year old son and six-month old daughter.

When asked which part of the story was false, the man said he had no comment and hung up.\n\nThe Russian military has not publicly disclosed any specific strikes in or near Binin on October 23. On October 26, the Russian Defense Ministry said on its website it had launched 164 combat sorties targeting 285 \"terrorist objects\" in the past three days across Syria, including in Idlib province.\n\nThe Russian military said it began airstrikes in Syria in September 2015 against Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, and other militant groups. Russia has come under criticism by Syrian rebels and their supporters for using the strikes as an excuse to target all rebels fighting the Assad government, a long-time strategic ally of Russia. Human rights and civil society groups have criticized the strikes for indiscriminately killing and even targeting civilians.\n\nIn a report citing \"battlefield sources\" SANA claimed Aledel was one of 13 Ahrar al-Sham members killed by Syrian airstrikes near Binin. Ahrar al-Sham, whose fighters have links to Al-Qaeda, is a leading member of the Jaish al-Fateh coalition that includes Al-Qaeda's official branch in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra. At the time of Aledel's death, the coalition comprised one of the strongest fighting forces countering the Assad government and Islamic State.\n\nAledel's Twitter page featured a picture of many of Ahrar al-Sham's leaders who had been killed, and he memorialized on social media leaders of other rebel groups who have died. CPJ did not find any evidence that Aledel participated in fighting. A month before his death, Aledel posted a picture of himself raising a camera in the air and said it was the weapon he chose to support the revolution.\n\nAccording to news reports, Aledel defected from the Syrian army at the start of the uprising and began working in media. He first worked in the media office for the opposition coalition group, Syrian Revolution General Commission, filming fighting and other stories from his hometown of Maarat al-Numan and other parts of Idlib province. He later worked a freelancer for local and international outlets, including Al-Jazeera and Turkey's state-run outlet Anadolu Agency, who both reported his death.\n\nIn August 2015, he helped found the Maarat Media Center, a collective of journalists from his hometown. According to the center, the group reports independently from Maarat al-Numan and its environs in an attempt to unify opposition forces in the fight against the Assad government. In the weeks before Aledel's death, the center focused its reporting on what it called the \"Russian aggression,\" filming what it said were civilian casualties caused by Russian airstrikes.\n\nOn October 6, 2015 the group published a video of Aledel reporting on anti-Russian protests in Idlib and the silence of the international community.

Surur was waiting with two accomplices, who have not been publicly identified, and the apartment's windows had been covered to hide the attack from onlookers, Ahmed Abd al-Qader said. He added that he believes Surur fled to Syria after the murder.According to Turkish media reports published the week after the murders, police found three footprints in blood and camera footage of one of the suspects. One police source, who was not named, told NBC that evidence implicated Surur in the murders.Since the start of the conflict, numerous Syrian journalists have operated independent media outlets in Turkey, including Eye on the Homeland. The Turkish authorities have largely allowed these outlets to report on Syria without harassment but Syrian journalists have repeatedly told CPJ they face restrictions on reporting on events inside Turkey and fear the Turkish government is not doing enough to protect them from potential threats emanating from Syria. Members of Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently and Eye on the Homeland told CPJ they receive death threats on a daily basis for their reporting on Islamic State.Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, one of the few reliable and independent sources of news left in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, was established in April 2014. The group has been declared an \"enemy of God\" by Islamic State in retribution for its reporting. Eye on the Homeland, which was founded by a group of Syrian journalists and activists, reports on events in Syria through its website and a semi-monthly newspaper, according to the group's website.Police in the southeastern Turkish city of Urfa arrested a man news reportsidentified only as Muaz Al-A, whom police suspect murdered  Hamadi and Abd al-Qader. Turkish intelligence and police officers allege the man is a member of the Islamic State group and crossed the border to Syria after the killings, but that he recently returned to Turkey, the daily newspaper Habertürk reported on August 14."},{"id":1319,"location":"Turkey","year":"2015","name":"Naji Jerf","organization":"Hentah, Raqqa is being slaughtered silently","date":"December 27, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Gaziantep","description":"Jerf, editor-in-chief of the independent monthly Hentah and the maker of documentary films on the militant group Islamic State, was shot in front of a building that houses Syrian opposition news outlets in downtown Gaziantep in Turkey, near the Syrian border, on the afternoon of December 27, according to news reports.A silenced pistol was used in the attack on the filmmaker, who was shot in the head and chest, according to reports. Jerf, who had recently finished a documentary on the Syrian citizen journalist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, was taken to a Turkish hospital where he later died, according to news reports.Some supporters of Islamic State celebrated the killing on social media and the Saudi-owned pan-Arab Al-Arabiya news channel said the militant group claimed responsibility in a statement.Jerf's murder came amid a campaign of violence by Islamic State against members of RBSS and other Syrian journalists. On December 16, 2015, Ahmed Mohamed al-Mousa, a 23-year-old editor for RBSS, was shot dead in Idlib province. In October 2015 Ibrahim Abd al-Qader was killed alongside fellow journalist Fares Hamadi in Urfa, southeastern Turkey.In a video published online on March 8, 2016 by Islamic State's local branch in Deir Ezzor, Syria, the militants claimed responsibility for the murders of all four journalists. The video, \"Escaping won't do you any good,\" showed two new hostages who identified themselves as Mohamed al-Kardoush and Jamal al-Ati, whom the militants accused of providing information to Western governments. It was not immediately clear if the hostages were journalists. Jerf had produced a documentary about Syrian activists being killed by Islamic State in Aleppo in 2013 and 2014. The documentary, which he published on his YouTube channel in December 2015 and which aired on pan-Arab satellite channel Al-Arabiya the month before, attracted more than 12 million views and tens of thousands of comments on Al-Arabiya's Facebook page, the channel reported. Jerf also directed a documentary on RBSS, the group CPJ honored in November 2015 with its International Press Freedom Award.Shortly before his death, Jerf had been issued a visa so he could move to France with his family, according to Reporters Without Borders. The Paris-based organization, which supported his visa application, said Jerf had received threats over his work documenting Islamic State atrocities. Zara Hasan, a Syrian activist who said she accompanied Jerf to the hospital after he was shot, told CNN the filmmaker also received death threats from Islamic State.On January 10, the Guardian cited Turkish state media as reporting that three men suspected of being involved in his killing were in custody in Gaziantep.On June 9, 2017, the Second Gaziantep Court of Serious Crimes sentenced Yusuf Hamed Eşveri to two life terms in prison plus five years and five months for killing Jerf. He was convicted on charges of \"pre-planned murder,\" \"attempting to overthrow the constitutional order by force\" and violating the laws for owning weapons and explosives, Turkish media reported.Three other suspects, Farag al-Hussein, Ali Çerkez and Reyad Matar, were acquitted for lack of evidence.A person in close touch with Jerf’s family told CPJ that the journalist’s relatives were not satisfied with the legal process and that they had not been represented by a lawyer of their own. Jerf’s relatives said the trial happened behind closed doors and it was not clear why the three other suspects were acquitted, this person said."},{"id":1652,"location":"Ukraine","year":"2015","name":"Serhiy Nikolayev","organization":"Segodnya","date":"February 28, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Peski","job":"Photographer","medium":"Print","coverage":"Human Rights, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Unknown Fire","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Ukrainian photographer Serhiy Nikolayev, who worked for the Kiev-based daily Segodnya, was killed in crossfire while covering fighting between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian separatists in the village of Peski, northeast of the major rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, the news agency Reuters reported.

The families' statement also says the Houthi militiamen searched the journalists' car and confiscated their equipment before capturing and imprisoning them.\nQabil's body was recovered on May 25, and al-Ayzari's the next day, according to news reports.

The journalists were found days after they had been abducted.\nThe building was hit by an airstrike on May 21, which was launched by a Saudi-led coalition of countries against Houthi militias in the city of Dhamar, news reports said.\nOn May 20, 2015, al-Ayzari and Qabil were kidnapped by militiamen allegedly affiliated with the Houthi movement and its allies, according to the journalists' employers and news reports. Yemen Youth TV, Suhail TV, and the journalists' families, who issued a statement to the press, said the two were returning to the city of Dhamar after covering a meeting by tribesmen opposed to the Houthis in the Al-Hada region, northeast of the city. The statements by Yemen Youth TV and the journalists' families said that the two journalists were in a car with a third man, Hussein al-Aysi, when they were stopped at a checkpoint manned by the Houthis. The families' statement also says the Houthi militiamen searched the journalists' car and confiscated their equipment before capturing and imprisoning them.\nQabil's body was recovered on May 25, and al-Ayzari's the next day, according to news reports. Dozens of other victims were also suspected to have been killed in the same air strike, the reports say. Al-Aysi was not killed in the air strike, news reports said. It is unclear what Al-Aysi's role was with Qabil and al-Ayzari.\nNews reports and a statement from the Yemeni Journalists Syndicate said the building that was hit in the air strike was an earthquake monitoring station. Belqees TV, Yemen Youth TV, and Suhail TV released statements blaming the Houthis for the deaths of the two reporters and alleging that the Houthis used the journalists as human shields to protect a military installation. After the strike, the head of the earthquake monitoring station told the media that there was no military value to the site, according to news reports.\nHouthi rebels took control of the capital, Sana'a, and other cities in September 2014, eventually forcing the government to resign, according to news reports. On March 25, a Saudi Arabia-led coalition of 10 countries began launching air strikes, targeting territory controlled by the Houthi militia, in an attempt to restore the exiled president who fled Yemen later that month as the Houthis increased their control over the country. Around the time that the air strikes began, outlets critical of the Houthis or affiliated with coalition governments were raided by Houthi forces and their staff temporarily detained, according to CPJ research.\nBoth al-Ayzari and Suhail TV were attacked by Houthi militiamen in prior months. According to Suhail TV, al-Ayzri was captured by the Houthis in early April. He was released on April 9 when the militiamen retreated from the area in which he was being held, according to the journalist's Facebook page. The offices of Suhail TV in Sana'a were raided in March by Houthi militia members, according to a statement by the outlet, and several staff members were taken hostage, according to CPJ research. According to news reports, the channel is closely linked to the Islah Party, a political opponent of the former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has allied with the Houthi movement.\nThe Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen has resulted in a large number of civilian casualties. Saudi military officials, facing criticism, have accused Houthi forces of using human shields and fighting within civilian populations, according to news reports.\nAl-Masirah TV, the official news outlet of the Houthi movement, said the bombing in Dhamar resulted in a number of civilian casualties and the destruction of many buildings that had no military usage. The station did not mention the deaths of the two journalists.\nCPJ called the press office of the Saudi Embassy in Washington in May 2015, seeking comment on the journalists' death, and was told by an embassy spokeswoman to submit questions via email. CPJ emailed questions to the embassy on the same day, which included whether the building was targeted because it allegedly was a military installation and if the coalition was aware that there were journalists being held in the building. CPJ has not received a response."},{"id":431,"location":"Afghanistan","year":"2016","name":"David Gilkey","organization":"National public radio","date":"June 5, 2016","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Marjah district","job":"Photographer","medium":"Radio, Internet","coverage":"Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","description":"David Gilkey, 50, died from severe burns he sustained when the convoy he was travelling in came under attack, according to his employer, the U.S. public broadcaster National Public Radio.

He had been disfigured, and suffered machete and bullet wounds, the police said.\nGarcía, 23, had been working in community radio since he was 13, when he joined a local youth anti-violence program. He had been working in a leadership role in the radio station since at least 2013, a colleague of García, who preferred to remain anonymous out of fear of reprisal, told CPJ.\nAngélica Cárcamo, education coordinator of the Association for Radio and Participatory Programs (ARPAS), who had known García for five years, told CPJ that Expressa's programming included a variety of topics, including music, human rights, religion, and anti-violence programming. Expressa is one of seven community radio stations in the area.\nAfter the killing, ARPAS and two other prominent Salvadoran journalist organizations released a joint statement condemning the killing. The groups said they believed the murder was linked to García's work at the radio station.\nViolence between criminal groups has made El Salvador the murder capital of the Western Hemisphere, and one of the most dangerous countries in the world outside of a war zone, according to press reports. Homicides spiked after a truce between the dominant rival youth gangs Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 broke down in 2014.\nLocal journalists and police officers who spoke with CPJ described Tacuba as a municipality deeply affected by gang violence. Police told CPJ that El Carrizal, where García lived, is mostly controlled by MS-13, but that neighboring towns are dominated by Barrio 18.\nCárcamo said that she believed there were three motives behind García's murder, and all were in retaliation for his work in the radio. She said that García had refused to be recruited by the gangs, had banned criminals from using the radio to broadcast, and had granted police space on the radio as part of a violence-prevention program. She added that García was a target for recruitment because of his age, but also as a result of his prominent position in the radio and in the community.\nCárcamo said that she had seen García only five days before the killing and she didn't know of any threats at that time. After his death, she was told by local colleagues that in fact García received death threats weeks before the murder.\nHis colleague who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to CPJ that García was threatened two weeks before his murder. \"The threats were related to his program on youth violence prevention,\" he said. At the time of the killing, García was directing the radio by himself, his colleague said. García had banned several people from participating in his programs because of their links with criminals.\nLocal police said there may be another reason for his killing. Pedro Antonio Alas, head of the Tacuba police, told CPJ that he believed García may have been killed for his friendship with the local leader of the Barrio 18 gang, involved in community radio in a neighboring town. Alas said that García was not a gang member, but speculated that members of MS-13 -- the rival gang -- could have killed García in retaliation. Alas did not discount the possibility that Garcías was killed for not allowing gang members to use the radio station.\nSerafín Valencia, the director of the Association of Salvadoran Journalists, told CPJ that journalists and activists who work for community radio are often vulnerable to threats from criminal groups and local politicians, who have been linked at times with organized crime.\nOn October 21, the attorney general's office announced that four gang members involved in the killing of Humberto García were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, according to reports on local news sites.

The family and news reports that cited initial police and medical statements said that Zaynadin was shot. Later police and medical reports said that the journalist was killed by a wild animal and that no gunshot wounds were found on the body, according to news reports and the family.\n\nThe journalist's family told CPJ through a translator that Zaynadin had been missing for two days before Karo came to their home to tell them he died while hunting. The family said that Zaynadin had never previously left on a trip without telling them where he was going.\n\nZaynadin worked for KNN, a Kurdistan-based television and online news agency closely affiliated with Kurdistan's opposition Change (Gorran) Movement party.

He also sold content to local and international networks on a freelance basis.\nAl-Zintani was covering an offensive by the Saiqa against Islamist militias at the time of his death, according to his colleagues and news reports. The Saiqa's media office released a statement announcing the death of seven of its members on June 24, including al-Zintani, who was described as a media professional. Some of the work produced by the photographer, who had an unarmed role in the forces, was used internally by the Saiqa and some was used to promote the group on local channels, according to colleagues of al-Zintani.\nAfter he was hit, al-Zintani was taken to a hospital in Benghazi, where he died later that day from his injuries, Omar Altwati, a freelance producer with whom al-Zintani had worked in the week before his death, told CPJ. According to Altwati and local news reports, the sniper likely belonged to the Islamist militias fighting for territory in and around Benghazi. CPJ was unable to determine if any group took responsibility.\nThe journalist had worked for multiple Libyan outlets, including al-Zintan TV, which released a statement paying tribute to him after his death. In the weeks before his death, he had worked closely with Altwati, a freelancer who produces video and images for Sky News Arabia TV, which is part-owned by British Sky Broadcasting and has headquarters in Abu Dhabi. A spokesperson for Sky News Arabia TV told CPJ that it did not deal directly with al-Zintani. \nAltwati, the producer, told CPJ that al-Zintani had provided him with images of fighting in Gwersha earlier in June and that they communicated on June 23, the day before al-Zintani was killed. Records of text messages between the two journalists, viewed by CPJ, show that al-Zintani said on June 23 that he would cover any fighting for Altwati in the area in the coming days.\nAltwati said he did not hear from al-Zintani again and when he tried to call him on June 24, the photographer's phone was turned off. Altwati said that another journalist told him al-Zintani had been killed covering a Libyan National Army offensive that day. Altwati told CPJ that he confirmed the death with a military spokesperson, who also said al-Zintani was with a Saiqa unit at the time he was hit.\nA YouTube channel in al-Zintani's name contains videos dating back to 2012, mostly about the fighting in Libya. Videos from the past three months before his death include a report about the Libyan National Army reclaiming a cement factory in Benghazi from Islamist militias, and promotional reports about the Libyan National Army's air force. The videos are marked as filmed and produced by al-Zintani.\nAl-Zintani took up photojournalism in 2011 after the Libyan uprising against Muammar Qaddafi. Brian Conley, director of the U.S.-based company Small World News, which provides training to citizen journalists, told CPJ he met al-Zintani in Libya in 2011 when the journalist was covering fighting in the town of Zintan. He said that they met again in 2012 at a video production workshop that Conley ran in Benghazi. Conley said he helped al-Zintani sell content to U.S. television networks. The two later discussed collaborating on running workshops for young journalists in Libya, but the project never materialized, Conley said.\nBenghazi has been the scene of fierce fighting in 2016 between units belonging to the internationally recognized Libyan National Army, led by General Khalifa Haftar, and Islamist militias, some with affiliations to the militant group, Islamic State."},{"id":225,"location":"Mexico","year":"2016","name":"Anabel Flores Salazar","organization":"El sol de orizaba","date":"February 8 or February 9, 2016","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Veracruz","freelance":"No","description":"The body of Anabel Flores Salazar, a reporter for El Sol de Orizaba who was abducted from her home near the city of Orizaba in Veracruz on February 8, was found the following day in the neighboring state of Puebla, according to a statement from the Veracruz Attorney General's Office.\nAt least eight armed assailants dressed in what appeared to be military uniforms forced their way into Flores Salazar's home at about 2 a.m. on February 8 and went straight to her room, the journalist's aunt, Sandra Luz Salazar, who was in the house at the time, told CPJ in a telephone interview. The assailants claimed they had a warrant for the reporter's arrest, pointed weapons at family members, then forced Flores Salazar into one of three gray trucks outside, Luz Salazar said.\n\"We pleaded with them not to take her. I told them that she had recently had a baby,\" she said.\nFlores Salazar, who covered local crime and police activities, had a new baby and a four-year-old son, according to news reports.\nOn the day of the abduction, the attorney general's office released a statement saying that they were investigating the case. The statement said that in August 2014 Flores Salazar had been in the company of an alleged member of an organized crime group at the time of his arrest, but did not provide further details.\nWhen CPJ asked Luz Salazar about that aspect of the attorney general's public statement, she said her niece had been having dinner with her family when police arrested the suspected criminal, who was at the same restaurant but not with them.\nThe day after the statement was released, 43 journalists from central Mexico and the state of Veracruz wrote an open letter in which they urged the state government to \"stop criminalizing murdered journalists.\" CPJ has documented several cases in which Veracruz authorities have made unfounded accusations linking murdered journalists to criminals.\nJosé Martínez Sánchez, a spokesperson from the Veracruz Attorney General's office, told CPJ authorities have not discarded any lines of investigation, but could not comment on specific details of the case.\nOn February 13, the governor of Veracruz, Javier Duarte Ochoa, alleged in a tweet that Josele Márquez Balderas, who is imprisoned and has been linked to the Zetas drug cartel, had ordered the killing of Flores Salazar. Duarte also tweeted that Flores Salazar had been using a Facebook account under a pseudonym to denounce a Zetas cartel leader. Duarte did not provide any evidence to back up this claim.

She had also reported on murders and car accidents for El Sol de Orizaba. A representative of El Sol de Orizaba told CPJ that the paper's directors were unavailable to comment on the case. News reports also described Flores Salazar as a former contributor to the daily newspapers El Buen Tono and El Mundo de Orizaba.\nFlores Salazar's former employer, El Buen Tono, has distanced itself from the case. In a radio interviewed cited in local media, the owner of El Buen Tono, José Abella, alleged that Flores Salazar had been fired from the magazine eight months earlier because she owned a car that did not correspond with her income. Abella claimed that this was a sign of her involvement with organized crime.\nOther journalists from the area have called Abella's claim into question, casting doubts about his knowledge of the case and raising concerns about his alleged links to the Veracruz government, according to press reports. Morales told CPJ that El Buen Tono generally took a pro-government editorial line.\n\"She was not a criminal,\" said Morales, who knew Flores Salazar but did not work closely with her. He told CPJ that local journalists know which of their colleagues are involved in organized crime. Morales said that he and his colleagues had never heard of Flores Salazar's being linked to criminal groups. \nBut Morales also raised doubts about Flores Salazar's journalism being the motive for her murder. Morales said that Flores Salazar did not write the type of stories that were likely to cause retribution. \"She mostly covered accidents and crashes,\" he told CPJ.\nOn May 4, the Veracruz attorney general's office released a statement announcing the arrest of an individual it identified only as \"G.P.V.\", who, the office alleged, was involved in the murder. According to the statement, prosecutors determined that the motive for the killing was related Flores Salazar's journalism, which affected the interests of a criminal group.\nOn August 10, police arrested another individual accused of planning and executing the crime on charges of abduction and homicide, according to news reports. The individual, identified only as \"Manuel N\" is a leader of the criminal group Las Zetas, according to a statement by the Veracruz Attorney General's Office.\nMorales Alejo told CPJ that a new protocol prevented the attorney general's office from publishing the full names of those accused of crimes.

He also worked as an assistant to a local councilman, the Veracruz state attorney's office said in a statement. In the past, Torres had been a reporter for portal Radiover.com, newspaper El Noreste de Poza Rica, and a correspondent for national broadcaster TV Azteca, according to press reports. He had also regularly contributed to a number of regional publications, and was a recipient of the State Journalism Award in 2009.\nThe Veracruz state commission for the protection of journalists condemned the murder and, in a brief statement, called for the authorities to investigate. The Veracruz state attorney general's office identified him only as an \"assistant of a local councilman.\"\nColleagues and others who knew Torres told CPJ that they were unaware of any specific threats against him. One former colleague, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, said he and many of his fellow journalists in Veracruz were \"baffled\" by the murder.\nAccording to Torres' colleague, the journalist had launched Noticias MT last year, publishing news articles on local affairs. He told CPJ the victim had covered police news when he worked for El Noreste de Poza Rica, but had stopped reporting on violence and crime altogether several years ago. He had recently covered election campaigns in the region and local teacher examinations.\n\"We really don't know where the attacks come from anymore,\" the same reporter told CPJ. \"This is another blow to journalism in the state.\"\nVeracruz is a hub for drug and human trafficking and has been the site of violent battles between organized crime groups for almost a decade.

At the time of the attack, the freelance correspondent for the regional newspaper El Piñero de la Cuenca and news website Al Calor Político was enrolled in a Veracruz state-sponsored protection program for journalists who have been threatened and was under police protection, after temporarily fleeing Veracruz earlier this year. Colleagues and authorities were unable to tell CPJ if the threats were in relation to his work.\nAccording to initial reports from police and news media, a black vehicle pulled up to Tamayo's residence at approximately 11 p.m. At the time, the journalist was sitting outside by a food stand that his wife runs from their home, a friend of the family who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, told the Committee to Protect Journalists. Two men exited the car, approached Tamayo, spoke with him briefly, then shot him at short range multiple times before fleeing.\nIn an interview with CPJ, Veracruz state Attorney General Luis Ángel Bravo said that the victim died of \"at least\" 10 bullet wounds while in an ambulance on his way to the hospital, and that \"more than 10\" cartridges from 9-millimeter bullets had been found at the crime scene. He said initial investigations suggested that the suspect's car had four occupants.\n\"Our main line of investigation is focused on the victim being killed because of his work as a journalist,\" Bravo told CPJ in a telephone conversation on July 21. \"But we are not disregarding other possible motives.\" Bravo said he was unaware of any threats Tamayo may have received in recent days or weeks, but repeated that the investigation was ongoing.\nAs part of the state protection program, police checked in on Tamayo on a daily basis. Bravo told CPJ that there was record of a state police patrol checking in with Tamayo in the morning of the day he was killed, but he did not provide further details. A close friend and colleague, who asked to remain anonymous because of fear of reprisal, told CPJ the police patrol did not show up on the day of the attack.\nTamayo's colleague said that the journalist had worked with Veracruz law enforcement as an informant. \"He would provide law enforcement with information about organized crime he gathered while he was working as a reporter,\" the colleague told CPJ. \"It is not an uncommon phenomenon in Veracruz, though not openly spoken about.\"\nBravo confirmed to CPJ that there was a \"registry of a professional relationship\" between Tamayo and state law enforcement, but said he was unable to provide more details as to what the relationship entailed.\nThe Veracruz state attorney general's office said in a press release on July 21 that eight police officers had voluntarily appeared before the prosecutor to answer questions in relation to the case.\nThe working relationship with state authorities ended after Tamayo fled Veracruz temporarily on January 25 following death threats, his colleague told CPJ. The colleague did not specify what the threats were related to. He said that Tamayo, his two sons, and his daughter-in-law found refuge in the state capital of Xalapa for 40 days and then spent another two weeks in Tijuana, in the state of Baja California, before returning to Tierra Blanca on March 8.\nAccording to federal human rights sub-secretary Roberto Campa, interviewed on July 21 by the Mexico City newspaper Reforma, at the time Tamayo was offered the chance to enroll in the federal mechanism to protect journalists and was warned that it was still too dangerous for him to return to Tierra Blanca, but that the journalist refused. Tamayo's colleague said he was unaware of such an offer being made to the journalist.\nTamayo reported mostly on crime, social issues, and protests.

According to the newspaper Proceso, Blanco said she had received threats from the men who allegedly killed her husband. Hiram Gamboa, spokesperson for the Regional Deputy Attorney General's Office Zona Centro in Veracruz, told CPJ that authorities had initiated an investigation into the fire.\nVeracruz is one of Mexico's most violent states. A number of organized crime groups have been involved in confrontations over lucrative drug and human trafficking routes.

Sheremet was a 1998 recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award.\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko condemned Sheremet's murder, requested that top law enforcement officials personally oversee the probe, and urged them to seek assistance from the FBI and other international law enforcement experts, according to a statement on the president's website.\nAccording to reports in the local and international press, investigators said that they were investigating Sheremet's journalism as the primary motive in a case of premeditated murder. Authorities also said they were investigating the possibility that the killers had sought to kill Alena Pritula, owner and former editor ofUkrainska Pravda, whose car Sheremet was driving when he died, Ukrainska Pravda reported. Poroshenko ordered law enforcement agencies to place Pritula under protection, Ukrainska Pravda said.\nSheremet's friends told journalists that he and Pritula had complained of being followed in Kiev. Sheremet told Reuters in October 2015 that he did not feel safe visiting Moscow, where had previously worked as a journalist.\n\"I'm threatened often and given hints. Every time I go to Moscow, it's like I'm in a minefield,\" he told the news agency.\nIn his work for Ukrainska Pravda, Sheremet commented on political developments in Ukraine, Russia, and his native Belarus. In the weeks before his murder, he had written about Ukrainian volunteer battalion fighters' joining criminal gangs after leaving the militias, petty corruption among police in Belarus, alleged corruption among Ukrainian government officials and police, and the work of Russian government propagandists.\nSheremet was originally from Belarus. He was producer and anchor of a weekly news and analysis show called Prospekt on Belarus state TV's Channel 1 for a year, until President Aleksandr Lukashenko's government ordered it off the air in April 1995.\nIn 1995, Sheremet began working for the Russian broadcaster ORT, and that year won the Belarus PEN Center's Adamovich Prize as best television reporter in Belarus. He edited independent Belarussian newspaper Belarusskaya Delovaya Gazeta. In 1997, Belarussian authorities jailed him for three months in connection to his reporting, and stripped him of his citizenship in 2010.\nIn an October 18, 2016, interview with the news agency Ukrinform, Ukraine's deputy police chief, Vadim Troyan said, \"Definitely, there has been progress\" in the case, but did not provide further details on the grounds that it could harm the investigation."},{"id":792,"location":"USA","year":"2016","name":"Jacinto Hernández Torres","organization":"La estrella","date":"June 10-12, 2016","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Garland","freelance":"No","description":"The body of Jacinto Hernández Torres was found the night of June 13 in Garland, a suburb of the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, in the southern U.S. state of Texas. The journalist, who went by the name Jay Torres, was a freelance contributor for nearly 20 years to La Estrella, the Spanish-language publication of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He also worked in real estate.\nOn June 14, investigators said that Torres, 57, had died from a gunshot wound and that police were treating the death as a homicide, according to a press release by the Garland Police Department. The police said it appeared Torres had been killed several days before the body was found.\nAline Torres, the journalist's daughter, said her father had been missing since June 10. \"I sent him a text around 6 p.m. on Friday but he never responded,\" she told reporters at a press conference on June 15.\nThe journalist, who lived in Dallas, was in Garland to look at property in relation to his work in real estate. His business partner found his body on the back patio of a house that was for sale and open to prospective buyers on Friday, according to news reports. Gibrán Torres, the journalist's son, told reporters that his father met with a contractor at the house that Friday.\nLa Estrella confirmed that at the time of his death Torres was working on a story about Mexican professionals who had migrated to the United States and were now working in construction, restaurants, and service-sector jobs, according to a report published in the newspaper.\nTorres covered local issues for La Estrella. He had recently written about residents' opinions on the Mexican elections, a local meeting on the dangers of underage drinking, and the effect of U.S. voter-identification laws.\nAline Torres, who lived with him, said she believes that there could be a link between her father's journalism and his death. She told reporters at a press conference that at one point he had been working on a couple of sensitive stories on illegal immigration and human trafficking, although she said that she did not know further details.\nThe director of La Estrella, Juan Antonio Ramos said that he talked with Jay Torres the week before his death about details of his assignment. \"The details we spoke of were routine and at no moment did we think that there was a risk. Jay was a very dedicated and careful person, who always kept us informed about his work. For this reason, his murder is alarming and worrisome,\" Ramos said in a statement published by the newspaper the week that he was reported murdered.\nGibrán Torres told CPJ that his father had asked about installing a security system on the house in the months before his death. He recalled his father mentioning both that he was investigating riskier stories and that he was worried about dealing with angry tenants as part of his real-estate business.\nA police spokesperson told CPJ that police are pursuing many different leads, and that the investigation is ongoing. A June 22 report in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said that police did not think that the murder was related to a robbery, and that they were looking at Torres's reporting notebooks, as well as more than 30 tenants who live in property owned by Torres's company.\nTorres was born in Monterrey, Mexico, but immigrated to the United States in 1979.

Al-Shaibani, who is not wearing clothing identifying him as a journalist, can be seen running, clutching a satchel, when he suddenly falls to the ground with a gunshot wound to the head. Later, two men in military clothing attempt to pull al-Shaibani off the street, but they also come under fire.\nResidents of Taiz have endured a months-long siege as a patchwork of pro-government and Islamist groups resist attempts to take the city by fighters belonging to Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. A month before al-Shaibani's death, a crew working for Al-Jazeera in the city were abducted for several days by unknown gunmen before being released.\nAhmed al-Basha, a Yemeni photographer who contributes to Agence France-Presse, told CPJ that he, al-Shaibani and a group of other journalists had gone to Al-Hasab neighborhood of western Taiz to report on a fire in a plastics factory that had been hit by a shell believed to be from pro-Houthi fighters. Al-Basha stayed behind with some of the journalists, as others, including al-Shaibani, left the factory site. As al-Basha returned from the factory, he photographed a puddle of blood in the street shown in the Yemen Shabab video, only to find out later the blood was al-Shaibani's. \nAl-Basha told CPJ that what he believed to be pro-Houthi gunmen purposefully targeted the journalists, saying that he too had come under fire crossing that street as he returned from the factory. In a report filed two days before the killing, Sky News Arabic correspondent Mohammed al-Qadhi said that Houthi forces had deployed snipers on the street.\nAl-Basha told CPJ that all the journalists who went to the factory had to cross the same street, including another Yemen TV journalist, Ahmed al-Bokari. Al-Bokari wrote on his Facebook page that he crossed the street first and was waiting on the other side as al-Shaibani attempted to cross. After al-Shaibani was hit, two anti-Houthi fighters were able to retrieve him under fire and transport him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nAl-Shaibani's most recent reports for the website Yaman News were about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Taiz and attempts to distribute humanitarian assistance.\nThe administrator of the general email account for Yemen TV, who did not identify himself by name, told CPJ in an email that al-Shaibani was on his first assignment for the station the day he was killed. After Houthi forces took control of the capital of Sanaa in September 2014, they commandeered government institutions, including Yemen TV and other state media outlets. Yemen's internationally recognized government in exile in 2015 set up a rival station, also named Yemen TV, for which al-Shaibani worked, according to news reports.

According to IRIN, Mojalli considered fleeing Yemen multiple times but decided to stay to continue his work documenting the conflict.

Da Silva was walking his girlfriend to her house around 9:30 p.m. when two men jumped out from an abandoned lot, and warned the girlfriend to back off, Marcia Janine, the local police chief investigating the crime, told CPJ via phone. The two men then shot da Silva seven times: once in the head, arm, and right thigh, and twice in the throat and back. Da Silva died immediately, according to Janine.  The shooting occurred approximately one hour after da Silva blogged about the death of a young man in Aquiraz, and had promised to provide more information on the killing, according to news reports. Police investigated the murder in the immediate aftermath but said in October they reached a conclusion about the motive.\"We really believe he was killed because of the blog, because he denounced important traffickers and criminals from the area. We think it was retaliation,\" Janine told CPJ.Da Silva, who was better known by his nickname Gugu, wrote a popular blog called De Olho em Aquiraz (An Eye on Aquiraz), featuring news from the coastal town of about 80,000 people located in northeastern Brazil, about 1,325 miles from the capital, Brasília.The blog comprised short items of salacious gossip, along with regional crime stories, and political and entertainment news from around Brazil, according to news reports. Da Silva posted stories on his blog about local drug traffickers, Janine told CPJ.The traffickers were angry with da Silva because of his work and his close relationship with local police, his brother Luiz Gabriel da Silva told CPJ. Da Silva said his brother would tip off police on drug trafficking and other criminal activities, and received information from the police on cases to publish online. \"The motivation perhaps came from the denouncements he published,\" Luiz Gabriel da Silva told CPJ via telephone. \"Our mother was hooked on crack and he could never accept that. So he hated to see the drug traffickers driving around in their big cars. He posted photos of them on his blog whenever they were arrested.\" Luís da Silva's friendliness with Aquiraz's previous mayor led him to a job in the town's marketing department, his brother told CPJ. CPJ was unable to determine the precise nature of the work. Da Silva also hosted an afternoon radio show featuring about 90 minutes of music and news on a station funded by the mayor, his brother said. He left both positions in January 2017 when the mayor lost his bid for re-election. In January 2016, da Silva filed a police report alleging an unnamed person in local politics had threatened him. Janine said it was unclear whether the threats were related to da Silva's reporting. \"We never knew of threats, but we could feel that he was afraid,\" Luiz Gabriel da Silva said of his brother. He said he believed the journalist had faced increased danger for several months but that he told family members not to worry about it."},{"id":1097,"location":"Colombia","year":"2017","name":"María Efigenia Vásquez Astudillo","organization":"Renacer kokonuko","date":"October 8, 2017","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Colombia","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Radio","coverage":"Culture","gender":"Female","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Local Residents, Military Officials","description":"Radio reporter María Efigenia Vásquez Astudillo was shot on October 8, 2017, while reporting on clashes between indigenous community members and riot police in the department of Cauca in southwestern Colombia, according to news reports.

The community members set up a roadblock, where they were met by riot police. About 40 indigenous civilians were injured in the clashes, Isneldo Avirama, the community's governor, told the Bogota-based press freedom organization Fundación para la Libertad de Prensa (FLIP). During the confrontation, Vásquez was injured by a homemade weapon that could have come from either side, according to news reports. An official at the national Attorney General's office told CPJ the case is still under investigation and that authorities were investigating multiple hypotheses.According to FLIP, Vásquez was attending the protest as a community member, but was also documenting the event, which is common practice among the station's staff.  \"She had the same mission as the rest of us: to document [what was happening],\" Emildre Avirama, a colleague at Renacer Kokonuko, told FLIP.Renacer Kokonuko, which broadcasts from a small house in the indigenous territory, is the only official news outlet in the municipality of Puracé, according to FLIP.

According to the BBC, the journalist was sympathetic to the Maoist rebels and was involved in the reintegration of former rebels.K. Siddaramiah, the chief minister of Karnataka state, has ordered a 21-member special investigation team from the police to investigate Lankesh’s killing, according to the Indian Express. Inderjit Lankesh, the journalist’s brother, said in an interview with NDTV that India’s national agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation, should examine her case. He said that Gauri Lankesh received a lot of hate mail from those who sympathised with the Maoist rebels and said that the investigation should investigate whether Hindu extremists or Maoist rebels are behind the killing, according to India Today. B.T. Venkatesh, a lawyer who represented Gauri Lankesh, alleged in an interview with the media watchdog The Hoot that her murder “was a pre-planned and sinister attack by Hindu terror units.” The radical right-wing Hindu group Sanatan Sanstha condemned Lankesh’s killing, according to reports. The group said that the journalist was a Maoist sympathiser who it had nothing to do with, according to reports. Lankesh started her career in the 1980s, working as a reporter for English-language dailies including Mid-Day and The Times of India, and the weekly magazine, Sunday.

At the time of her death, she was appealing a six-month prison sentence and fine of 10,000 Indian rupee (US$155) for criminal defamation. The November 2016 conviction was over a 2008 article, according to a report on The Wire.

The car that she was driving exploded near to her house in Bidnija, in the north of the island, media reported.Caruana Galizia, who reported on government corruption and the Panama Papers, told police two weeks prior her death that she had received death threats, according to Malta's national broadcaster TVM, which did not provide further detail. The journalist's blog, Running Commentary, which included investigative reports and commentary on politicians, was one of the most widely read websites in Malta, according to reports.A forensic expert was cited in local media as saying that preliminary investigations suggest that explosives were not placed inside the car, and that a remote control could have been used to set the bomb off. Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced that the FBI had agreed to assist local police in the investigation, according to Reuters. Muscat condemned the attack, which he described as an \"attack on press freedom.\" The Prime Minister added in a statement, \"Everyone knows Ms. Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of mine, both politically and personally but nobody can justify this barbaric act in any way.\"Caruana Galizia's reports about Muscat's alleged connection to the Panama Papers scandal forced him to call early elections in June 2017, after harsh criticism from members of the European Parliament. The journalist alleged that Muscat and his wife were behind an offshore company that received over US$1 million in payments from a Dubai company allegedly owned by Leyla Aliyeva, daughter of Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev. Muscat denied the allegations, according to reports.Caruana Galizia's last blog, which was critical of the country's opposition party, was posted at 2:35 p.m. local time, just a few minutes before she left her house, according to local reports.The journalist's critical coverage led to several legal battles. The most recent came in August, when Malta’s opposition leader Adrian Delia filed four lawsuits against Caruana Galizia, and accused her of libel for reports she published on her blog. Caruana Galizia’s articles claimed that Delia laundered a total of £1 mln (U.S.$1.3 million) from prostitution in London through offshore accounts in his name, according to British and local media. Delia denied the allegations, and said the account belonged to his client. According to media reports, Delia also said he had resigned from the company that owned the property where the prostitution was allegedly taking place after becoming aware of the way in which it was being used.  CPJ documented in February how a court ordered Caruana Galizia’s bank accounts to be frozen until a verdict was reached in a libel case that two government officials had filed against her. A public fundraising campaign later raised enough cash to satisfy the court’s demands, according to EuroNews.On December 4, 2017, Maltese police, armed forces, and security services arrested 10 suspects in connection with the murder, Prime Minister Muscat announced. Seven were released on bail and three--Vince Muscat and two brothers named George and Alfredo Degiorgio--were charged with murder, criminal use of explosives, being involved in organized crime, and criminal conspiracy, according to reports. The three pleaded not guilty when they appeared before a judge in December 2017, Maltese media reported.In a statement, the Caruana Galizia family criticized the lack of communication from Maltese authorities regarding the arrests, saying that they were not contacted in advance and learned about the developments at the same time as the press. The manner in which the arrests were communicated, the family said, indicated “serious institutional deficiencies which are cause for general public concern.”Further, the family has taken legal action against the Maltese police, alleging that the investigation cannot be impartial because Caruana Galizia wrote critical articles about the chief investigator and the government minister to whom he is married, according to news reports. Members of the European Parliament who visited Malta in late November 2017 criticized the country's rule of law and noted a \"perception of impunity\" among government officials, according to reports."},{"id":366,"location":"Mexico","year":"2017","name":"Cándido Ríos Vázquez","organization":"La voz de hueyapán","date":"August 22, 2017","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Veracruz","medium":"Crime","coverage":"Male","gender":"Local","localorforeign":"No","threatened":"Unknown gunmen on August 22 attacked Cándido Ríos Vázquez in a drive-by shooting outside a convenience store in Juan Díaz Covarrubias, a town in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz, according to news reports.

As part of the program, the journalist had police protection, a mobile panic button, and security cameras at his residence.According to Veracruz media outlets, Ríos had drawn the ire of Gaspar Gómez Jiménez, a former mayor of Hueyapán, for his reporting of local issues.AGN Veracruz, a local news website based in the city of Puerto de Veracruz, reported on August 22 that Gómez Jiménez released a video earlier this month on social media sites in which he threatened to beat up Ríos.

The group's executive secretary Jorge Morales said their representatives are working with Ríos' family to determine if they will need protection in the future.The federal undersecretary for Human Rights Roberto Campa said he believed the attack to be unrelated to Ríos' work as a journalist, and that the incident was most likely related to Ríos' companions who also died at the scene.

Unknown assailants blocked his way, dragged him out of his car and shot him at least 12 times. Valdez died shortly after. The attackers fled in his vehicle, which was later found abandoned not far from the scene of the crime, state and federal authorities told CPJ in the days following the murder. They also told CPJ that Valdez's laptop computer and mobile phone had been taken.\nRiodoce magazine focuses mostly on organized crime, corruption, and regional politics.\nValdez was also the correspondent in Sinaloa for La Jornada, a Mexico City-based newspaper, and gained widespread national recognition for authoring a series of books that chronicle the Mexican underworld and the victims of Mexico's drug war.

Sinaloa is the home state of some of Mexico's most notorious drug lords and the base of operations of Sinaloa Cartel, one of Mexico's oldest and most powerful drug trafficking organizations. Since its inception, the magazine's fearless reporting, has often placed it at odds with powerful criminal and political interests, according to media reports. In 2009, a grenade was thrown at one of its editorial offices, but no one was hurt, according to news reports.\nJavier Valdez told CPJ in March 2017 that he was concerned for his safety. His newspaper La Jornada reported one day after his murder that he had received anonymous death threats since February, without specifying their nature. Several reporters who knew the victim well and who spoke with CPJ on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation could not confirm the threats. They did, however, say that the situation in the state had become \"tense\" after the January 2016 arrest and extradition to the United States of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the alleged founder of the Sinaloa Cartel. Guzmán's extradition has been widely cited in media reports as the immediate cause of a surge in violence in the state in recent months.\nRicardo Sánchez Pérez del Pozo, the Special Prosecutor for Crimes against Freedom of Expression (FEADLE) told CPJ in May 2017 that his office had taken charge of the investigation, with support from the Sinaloa state prosecutor's office.

Violence related to the sugar cane industry is common in the Córdoba region. According to Vicente Osorio, a journalist for El Sol de Córdoba and a friend of the victim, the economic interests in the industry sometimes lead to violent clashes between farmers and trade unions. On February 24, the leader of a local sugar cane farmers group was killed in a riot in Córdoba, according to news reports.\nMonliu's work as a spokesman for the National Union of Sugar Cane Producers and his journalism deeply embedded him in the industry, journalists in the region told CPJ.\nOsorio told CPJ that he was did not know of any threats against Monliu before the journalist's death. He also said that he was unaware of any conflicts in the sector that might have sparked animosity against the journalist. Morales, of CEAPP, told CPJ that Monliu had not been enrolled in any state or federal protection program for journalists."},{"id":1600,"location":"Mexico","year":"2017","name":"Salvador Adame Pardo","organization":"6tv","date":"June 1, 2017","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Between May 18 and June 26","job":"Broadcast Reporter, Publisher/Owner","medium":"Television","coverage":"Corruption, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group, Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Gunmen abducted Salvador Adame Pardo, director of the television station 6TV, on May 18, 2017, from the central Mexican town of Nueva Italia in Michoacán state, according to media reports.

The journalist had been traveling by motorcycle from the town of Fram to Carmen del Paraná, his home city, according to the paper. The journalist did not regain consciousness after the attack, and spent a year in the hospital unable to move or speak, ABC Color reported.  González was a radio reporter with the local station F.M. Costanera del Sur, and had previously reported on police complacency in cattle rustling, according to media reports.Local authorities' initial reports suggested that González's injuries were the result of a traffic accident.\"The investigation did not find signs that the vehicle had braked or that it was hit by another vehicle,\" Chief of Police Juan Barua said in an interview with online channel Itapúa en Noticias, which was published on YouTube in March 2016. \"We presume that this person [González] came at a high velocity and the motorcycle fell. It skidded over the asphalt for various meters,\" he added.González's family and colleagues called for further investigation, according to press reports. The journalist's father, Carlos González, told Paraguayan press after his son's death in March 2017 that he believes his son was murdered.ABC Color reported in July 2016 that no damage was found to the motorcycle and raised doubts about whether the injuries were the result of a traffic accident.Police had previously arrested González on charges the journalist said were retaliation for his reporting. In September 2014, Fram police arrested González and charged him with drug possession and trafficking after allegedly finding six balls of crack cocaine in his bag, according to a report in ABC Noticias from the time of the arrest. González said that police had planted the drugs on him in reprisal for his reporting with the radio station Trigal F.M., according to the report. Three days prior to his arrest, González had reported on cattle rustling, according to an interview the journalist gave to the news website Itapúa en Noticias, which was published on YouTube in June 2015. After González spent a year in house arrest, a local judge dismissed the charges, according to a separate ABC Color report. José Miguel González, the ABC Color correspondent in Itapúa and president of the Association of Periodistas in the South (APESUR) told CPJ that, a week before Eduardo González was found unconscious, the radio reporter said that he had agreed to informally settle with police for 50 million guaranis (US$9,000) in lieu of filing suit against them for wrongful arrest.The ABC Color correspondent said that he believed that Eduardo González was killed so that police could be rid of the case without paying. José Miguel González added that González had continued reporting on the collusion between police and cattle thieves on his radio program after he was released from house arrest. The national police station in Fram did not immediately respond to CPJ's request for comment in December 2017. After González's death, Edward Irala, the assistant prosecutor in Itapúa, told journalists during a press conference that the investigation into the circumstances under which González appeared unconscious on the roadside was still open after his death in March 2017. Irala said that prosecutors were also investigating the possibility that González was planning to file a wrongful arrest suit against the Fram police officers who had charged him with drug crimes, according to a video of the press conference from Itapúa en Noticias on YouTube."},{"id":407,"location":"Philippines","year":"2017","name":"Christopher Iban Lozada","organization":"Dbxf prime broadcasting network","date":"October 24, 2017","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Philippines","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Radio","coverage":"Corruption, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Unidentified gunman shot and killed Christopher Iban Lozada, a radio broadcaster with the privately owned DBXF Prime Broadcasting Network news station in the southern Philippines, on October 24, 2017. Lozda and his girlfriend were driving home in his car when unidentified men in a van ambushed them around 9 p.m. in the city of Bisling in Surigao del Sur province, according to news reports. The journalist was declared dead on the spot from multiple gunshot wounds to his chest, the reports said.

Purohit told CPJ that he took Sharma to the local hospital where the journalist was declared dead from injuries sustained in the crash.Purohit said both he and Sharma began receiving death threats last year after publishing two stories in July and October 2017 on alleged police corruption and illegal sand mining. The journalists shot a video that showed how a senior police officer accepted a bribe to allow the movement of vehicles carrying illegally mined sand, according to a report in the Indian Express newspaper. With strong demand for construction in India, illegal sand mining has increasingly become a problem because sand is difficult to transport and \"regulatory consequences are minimal\" for extracting it from off-limits areas, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.Purohit said local residents came to him and Sharma and said they would “crush them under a truck” for doing the stories. The villagers would also pass by the house when the journalists were home to intimidate them, Purohit said.Prashant Khare, the Bhind police superintendent, told CPJ that police were examining CCTV footage and that they had arrested the truck driver who hit Sharma. “A special investigation team has been formed to investigate whether this was an accident or it was a murder,” Khare said. Purohit told CPJ that about 10 days after News World aired Sharma's October investigation, the journalist was \"beaten up by a bunch of goons but was saved thanks to the presence of police.\" He said the thugs they didn’t specifically mention the report. According to Purohit, Sharma filed a formal complaint to the police about the beating, but they did not take further action. The News World bureau chief also said that he and Sharma wrote letters to government authorities, including the state's inspector general of police, to ask for government protection after they began receiving death threats, but they received no response.Khare confirmed that police received letters from Purohit and Sharma in December complaining about the threats. He said he had no knowledge of Sharma being beaten up.\"[T]he deputy superintendent of police conducted an inquiry and found that there was no threat to their lives,\" Khare told CPJ.Shivraj Singh Chouhan, chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state, recommended an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), according to government officials who were quoted by the Hindustan Times newspaper.

According to a statement given that same day by Roberto Álvarez Heredia, a spokesperson for the Guerrero state attorney general’s office, two unidentified attackers entered the restaurant and immediately approached Montenegro, who was sitting with her husband. The assailants fired at least two shots at Montenegro’s face and abdomen, before fleeing, according to the statement and initial police report to which CPJ had access. The report did not say whether the attackers said anything to Montenegro before shooting.The 36-year-old journalist ran a satirical YouTube channel and an online news magazine called El Sillón, which she founded in 2012.

El Sillón's Facebook page, which Montenegro administered with her husband, Samuel Muñuzuri, featured a variety of posts in the months before her death, including on topics such as beauty, culture, and politics.According to a February 6, 2018 statement from the Guerrero state attorney general Javier Olea, Montenegro had received threats in the months before her murder.

He was taken to a city hospital with serious injuries and died without regaining consciousness, the report stated. The journalist reported on corruption and crime in his native region of Sverdlovsk, according to the Guardian. In the few months prior to his death, Borodin reported on several sensitive subjects.He gained national attention for his reporting on the deaths in Syria of Russian private military contractors fighting on the side of President Bashar al-Assad, the Guardian reported. In February and March 2018, Borodin reported from the town of Asbest, home to several men who left to fight in Syria with Wagner Group, a paramilitary organization with alleged ties to the Kremlin that suffered dozens of fatalities in February following an attack by United States-backed forces in Syria. Borodin interviewed relatives and the contractors' superiors, and attended their funerals in Asbest. The Kremlin denies any connection with Russian contractors fighting in Syria.In February 2018, the Borodin reported on Russian opposition candidate and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny's expose of Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch with close ties to the Kremlin, who Navalny has alleged funneled illicit profits into offshore accounts. In August 2017, Borodin wrote about the Russian film \"Matilda,\" which was lambasted by the Russian Orthodox Church for its portrayal of the late Tsar Nicholas II's personal life. On April 16, 2018, an unnamed spokesperson for Yekaterinburg's branch of Russia's Investigative Committee, the agency tasked with probing serious crimes, told the state news agency TASS that Borodin's apartment was locked from the inside and \"there is no evidence of foul play.\" The spokesperson also said investigators did not find a suicide note in the journalist's apartment and that the journalist was sober when he fell. On April 23, 2018, the Investigative Committee told Novy Den that they will not open a criminal investigation since there was \"no evidence of a crime,\" and the journalist's death will likely be treated as a \"tragic accident.\"CPJ's calls to the Yekaterinburg branch of the Investigative Committee went unanswered.Yekaterina Norseyeva, a Novy Den correspondent in Yekaterinburg, told CPJ on April 16, 2018, that it was \"very unlikely\" that Borodin had committed suicide. \"He was going to be transferred to our Moscow bureau; he was full of plans,\" she said.A Yekaterinburg-based civil rights defender and Borodin's friend, Vyacheslav Bashkov, on April 15 wrote on his Facebook page that Borodin contacted him at 5 a.m. on April 11 and said that \"security forces\" wearing camouflage and face masks were on his balcony and in the interior staircase of his building. Borodin told Bashkov that he thought the security forces were waiting for a court order to search his apartment and asked Bashkov to help him find a lawyer, according to the Facebook post.Bashkov wrote on Facebook that Borodin called him back an hour later and said he was mistaken and the security officers were conducting a drill.In his Facebook post, Bashkov said that he went to local police after he found out about Borodin's death, but police seemed uninterested and \"did not question [him] about much.\" Bashkov told CPJ that he was not aware of Borodin's whereabouts between the telephone call and the time of the journalist's fall, which he said likely happened during the afternoon of April 12, 2018. Bashkov also said it had become a \"regular practice\" for law enforcement to conduct drills in Yekaterinburg ahead of the World Cup.On April 17, 2018, Novy Den Editor-in-Chief Polina Rumyantseva told the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta that three days prior to his death, Borodin had told her he had been under surveillance. \"I warned the building security. I also advised [Borodin] to report this to the police,\" she said, and added that Borodin did not go to the police. Novy Den issued a statement on April 19, 2018, saying they had no reason to disbelieve the Investigative Committee's conclusions calling Borodin's death \"tragic event.\"CPJ research shows that Borodin's demise fits a pattern of journalists in Russia dying as they cover sensitive issues with potential repercussions for authorities, under circumstances that are not fully explained or investigated."},{"id":817,"location":"Slovakia","year":"2018","name":"Ján Kuciak","organization":"Aktuality","date":"Between February 22 and 25, 2018","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Velká Mača","job":"Internet Reporter","medium":"Internet","coverage":"Business, Corruption, Crime, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group, Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"On February 25, 2018, Slovak investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his girlfriend, Martina Kušnířova were found shot to death in his house in Velká Mača, some 5 kilometers from capital Bratislava, Slovakia, local media reported.The journalist was shot in the chest with a single bullet, and his partner in the head, according to reports.Police chief Tibor Gašpar said that the murders were \"most likely\" linked to the work of the journalist, Reuters reported.

Yohannes was among 10 independent journalists\nrounded up in a massive 2001 government crackdown that shuttered the\nnation's private press.\nSeveral sources said Yohannes died on\nJanuary 11, 2007, after a long illness in an undisclosed prison outside\nAsmara; one source said the journalist may have died much earlier in a\nprison in Embatkala, 21 miles (35 kilometers) northeast of Asmara.\nIn\na June 2007 interview, Eritrean Information Minister Ali Abdu told CPJ\nthat he had nothing to say about Yohannes. \"I don't know,\" he said.\n\"This is an Eritrean issue; leave it to us. I have nothing to say.\"\nYohannes\nwent by the name of \"Joshua\" among family and friends. Formerly a\nmember of the guerrilla movement fighting for Eritrean independence\nfrom neighboring Ethiopia, he turned to journalism when Eritrea became\na state in 1993. In November 1997, he joined Setit as co-owner and board member, a former colleague told CPJ. He became a popular writer, and Setit grew into the nation's largest-circulation newspaper.\nSetit's\nstaff tackled tough issues in the young nation, including poverty,\nprostitution, and Eritrea's lack of infrastructure for handicapped\nveterans of the 30-year independence struggle.

Agence France-Presse quoted an unnamed police official in 2009 as saying that Manneh had been spotted at Mile 2 Prison outside Banjul in 2008, but the official also speculated that Manneh was no longer alive.Over the years, despite dozens of inquiries from international organizations, the government did not provide a credible account of what happened to Manneh after he was taken into custody. In 2008, the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) ruled that Gambia had unlawfully seized Manneh, and ordered his immediate release.In a nationally televised meeting with local media representatives in March 2011, Jammeh described Manneh as having died, but denied any government involvement in the journalist's fate. \"Let me make it very clear that the government has nothing to do with the death of Chief Manneh,\" he said.The justice minister at the time, Edward Gomez, provided contradictory information several months later. In an October 2011 interview with the local newspaper Daily News, Gomez said that Manneh was alive. In a subsequent interview with AFP, Gomez said, \"Chief Ebrima Manneh is alive, and we will talk about this case later.”In February 2012, Reuters reported that Jammeh had asked the United Nations to investigate Manneh's disappearance. \"In response to civil society complaints about the disappearance of a journalist in the Gambia, the president of Gambia asked for the U.N. to come in and investigate,\" the U.N.'s then High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said, according to Reuters. But in a subsequent interview with CPJ, a government spokesman denied having any knowledge of the request to the U.N.On June 10, 2014, the ECOWAS court held that previous rulings against the Gambia, including in Manneh's case, proved the then Gambian government was fostering a climate of impunity, which in itself was a violation of freedom of expression.In a statement in November 2014, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said that two U.N. special rapporteurs had been unable to complete their investigation into the legal protection of prisoners in the Gambia after the Jammeh government denied them access to its prisons. The statement said the fact-finding mission was suspended.In January 2017, Adama Barrow was elected president of the Gambia, renewing hope that justice may be served for journalists missing and imprisoned under the Jammeh regime.Asked about Manneh’s case, Demba Ali Jawo, Gambian information minister for the Barrow administration, told CPJ, “Officially we have not heard anything yet. We have been getting rumors. We haven't got a lead.”The Gambia is organizing a truth and reconciliation commission for the crimes committed under the former government, which Jawo said may result in new information on journalists."},{"id":999,"location":"Guatemala","year":"Unknown Year","name":"Laurent Ángel Castillo Cifuentes","organization":"Nuestro diario","date":"Late January, early February","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Guatemala","coverage":"Male","gender":"Local","localorforeign":"No","threatened":"Sugarcane field workers on February 1, 2018, found the bodies of newspaper reporter Laurent Ángel Castillo Cifuentes and his friend Luis Alfredo de León Miranda in a field outside the town of Santo Domingo, in Guatemala's southwestern Suchitepéquez deportment, according to news reports.

The Attorney General's office in Suchitepéquez, which falls under the jurisdiction of the federal Public Ministry, told CPJ in an email that a special unit of the Human Rights Attorney General's office that oversees crimes against journalists was investigating the case.Castillo, 28, covered sports and culture for the newspaper Nuestro Diario, and was based out of the town of Coatepeque, in Quetzaltenango department, which borders Suchitepéquez, the newspaper's regional editor Jorge Mario García told CPJ.Castillo's family members told reporters that he left his home on January 28 to cover a local carnival in Mazatenango, the capital of Suchitepéquez, but never returned. Castillo's father said he last spoke with his son the morning of February 1, according to the reports.De León, 30, a publicist for a local radio station, Coatepec, was accompanying his friend to the carnival, news reports said.According to the newspaper Prensa Libre, a source close to Castillo's family whose name was not given said the journalist had recently changed his phone number after receiving threatening phone calls from people attempting to extort him, but that the family was not aware of any issues related to his reporting. Garcia told CPJ he did not believe Castillo had received any threats for his reporting.Guatemala's national Human Rights Ombudsman, Jordán Rodas, on Twitter called for a swift investigation into their murders and urged the government to implement the Protocol for the Protection of Journalists.Guatemala's president in 2013 promised to create a federal protection plan for journalists, but the government has yet to implement it.Suchitepéquez and Quetzaltenango, near Guatemala's border with Mexico, have historically been hotspots for drug trafficking and violence, according to CPJ research. Garcia told CPJ that journalists in the region engage in self-censorship and are often afraid to report on local issues because they fear retaliation and violence."}]
